INTRODUCTION
============

        DOOM iNsAnItY started as a small joke in the first "Official" DOOM
FAQ v1.0.  It slowly grew, and by v5.0 of the FAQ, it was almost 20% of
100k FAQ!  I finally decided to release it as a seperate file.  This will
probably be the last release of DOOM iNsAnItY, so enjoy it while you can!

[1-1]: A word from Douglas J. Bottoms
=====================================
        FOREWORD:  Here's the first addition to DOOM iNsAnItY!
This was posted on comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Thursday,
October 21, 1993.  He speaks on a new game idea: id programmers
as bad guys in DOOM.

----------
Subject: NEW GAME!  id programmers as bad guys in DOOM!
From: Douglas J. Bottoms <DBottoms@Lilly.Com>
Date: Thu Oct 21 10:00:02 1993

That's it!!  I new twist on the game!!!  The DOOM good guys are idle
gaming buffs who have finally cracked and can no longer wait for the
release of the only game that will make ALL OTHER games seem like PONG!
Blind Wolfenstein will no longer simmer the anger!  They go slap-happy and
grab their multidimensional boots and gloves (with snazzy smooth shading)
and go to the id programmers' dungeon/lair.  It will be a slaughter!
Pixilated programmers, peeved project leaders, panting personnel...the
works.  The big bosses could be just that, the big bosses, especially the
one who just made a press release that DOOM would be delayed another few
months (this is make believe, of course - (squint) you aren't going to
delay the release (pant, pant);  look into my eyes  (o)(o) (imagine
reversing sound) and repeat after me, "I must release DOOM soon.  I must
program, eat, sleep day and night."  Mu who ha ha ha!).

Excuse my sanity.  I get a bit zany when I get thinking about the soon to
be released game that will resolve the U.S.' Deficit and save the rats
from being beheaded on the space shuttle.  I see the sun raising...

The thoughts expressed here are entirely my own and do not necessarily
reflect the thoughts of any other individual or group affiliated with Eli
Lilly and Company.

[1-2]: DOOM: The Real Thing
===========================
        FOREWORD: This messages was posted from gills@qucdn.queensu.ca on
Usenet in the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Monday,
November 15, 1993.  He has a new idea: playing DOOM in REAL LIFE!

----------
Howdy,

        Yes, like all you DOOM fans I have been eagerly awaiting the release
date for this landmark game.  Although I was very disappointed in the
release date being bumped up from 3rd quarter '93 to Dec 10, I limited my
anger and frustration to strangling my neighbour's cat (didn't like it much
anyways....   ;)   ).

        But, NOW I'm forced to read all the great stuff about the Beta
release that some people have been lucky enough to get their hands on.
....well, not FORCED to read it, but I can't help absorbing every bit of
information I can possibly locate.   :)

        I can't handle the fact that some people have tried the game now,
and I haven't, so I thought I might pull out my brass knuckles and 12 gauge
pump shotgun and start up a *REAL* DOOM game. I figured that I, and 3 other
frustrated DOOM awaiters, could meet up at an abandoned warehouse or
something and have a rip snortin' Death Match of our own.  We could throw
some shotgun shells and ammo boxes randomly around the place, along with
some first-aid kits (fine for light grazes from perhaps a .22 calibre round
but not much good for a 12 gauge belly wound  :)  ) - then we go at it !!!

        Granted, there won't be any monsters in this place, like there are
in DOOM, but I do have a pretty ugly cousin I could trick into coming; and
with a quick dunk in some gray paint I'm convinced he could bear a passable
resemblance to a gargoyle <G>.

So ....any takers?    Heh, heh, heh.

Note: This a JOKE, only a joke....that's J-O-K-E..as in, I'm not serious.
      If you are a certified nut-bar who would like to really try this out
      don't bother calling me up....I get faint from tension just playing
      Paintball   :)

        But, seriously...I CAN wait until Dec 10 to play DOOM but it's
getting pretty tense doing the waiting game.  I guess in the mean time I can
go pick up some Depends (adult diapers) and some I.V. supplies so I'll be
prepared on Dec 10 to stay on the computer playing DOOM steadily until I
collapse from exhaustion.
        Of course if a copy of Beta-DOOM *DID* happen to make it's way to
me, I would still download the shareware version and register/pay for the
full release.
I swear I would....really...I promise....scout's honor...anyone?..anyone?

OK, so sue me, I had to ask.       :)

P.S.    If this game is good as it's suppose to be, I'm gonna name my first
        born child "ID".... IDDY?...IDarina?...IDI-Sue?....

[1-3]: Beta-Tester's Joystick Sliced Off While Sleeping at Computer!
====================================================================
        FOREWORD:  I received this piece of hilarious E-mail from
John Romero.  This was written by Douglas Howell (one of the DOOM
Beta-testers) when id decided to axe the entire Beta-tester list and start
from scratch.  Douglas Howell will be reinstated as a Beta-tester, as
soon as his "joystick" heals. :)  Let the Bobbitt saga continue!

----------
NEWSFLASH:  Beta tester's joystick sliced off while sleeping
            at computer!

At a news conference today, a beta tester of software said that he had
fallen asleep while testing a game for id Software, developers of the
best-seliing game Wolfenstein 3D.  Awaking in the middle of the night,
he looked down and to his horror discovered that three-fourths of his
joystick had been sliced cleanly off.  When questioned, id Software
admitted to doing the deed and charged that the beta tester was a
two-timer.  Id spokesman Shawn Green stated-- "What was done had to be
done.  Id was definitely not satisfied by this guy's performance. All he
cared about was taking software and sticking it into other people's hard
drives!".

The severed joystick was later found by police on a street corner.
Apparently id had fled the scene with the sliced piece still in hand and
tossed it out a car window.  Surgeons have since sewn the stick back on,
but it seems to malfunction whenever playing id's beta software.
Doctors predict that the joystick should perform normally again by
December 10th.

[1-4]: The Night Before DOOM
============================

            Written by: Hank Leukart (ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         `Twas the night before DOOM,
                          and all through the house,
                   I had set up my multi-playing networks,
                              each with a mouse.
                          The networks were strung,
                           with extra special care
                             in hopes that DOOM,
                             soon would be there.
              The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
             while visions of demons danced through their heads.
                 And my computer's processor it was so quick,
                      boy was I glad I bought that 486.
             When out on the Internet there was a Usenet posting,
                I dialed right in to see what it was boasting.
                 Off to the news reader I flew like a hound,
                 "Oh no," I cried!  The news reader was down!
                 Frustrated, bewildered, feeling really low,
              I leaned back to see what I heard out the window.
                When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
                  but a group of 6 cars, driving 60 I fear!
                With a big young driver, just look at him go!
                 I knew in a moment, it must be John Romero!
                 Over the speed limit, his band of cars came,
            And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
                           "Now, Jay! Now, John!
                            Now, Dave and Kevin!
                           On, Adrian! On, Sandy!
                           On, Shawn and Robert!"
                         To the top of the driveway!
                             Don't hit that wall!
             Now stop your car, stop your car, stop your car all!
                    Leaving the car, he entered the house,
                Walking quietly, so as to not wake the spouse.
           He was dressed in a T-shirt, and a a pair of jeans too,
                   I was unsure of what he was going to do.
                   Boxes of DOOM he had flung on his back,
             and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
         Those boxes - how they sparkled!  The shrink-wrap so tight!
          The character was drawn on the front, just ready to fight!
                The Chain Saw and Shotgun he held in his hand,
              Where was the BFG9000?: The best gun in the land.
                   And then I saw it, strapped to his back,
                Along with a copy of the "Official" DOOM FAQ!
                A wink of John's eye and a twist of his head,
                 Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
             He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
            Installed it on the network, then turned with a jerk.
                      And placing a hand into his jeans,
                   out came his keys - oh how they gleamed!
             He sprang to his car, to the id team gave a whistle,
         and away they all drove, like DOOM's launching of a missile.
             But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
                 "DEMONS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A HELLISH NIGHT!"

[1-5]: You know you have been playing DOOM too much when...
===========================================================

        DOOM is a great game!  But don't let it take over your life! :)

        You know you have been playing DOOM too long...

...when going to sleep you open the bedroom's door and instead of turning
   lights on you fire a missile into the room.

...when you sleep with a chainsaw under your pillow,and justify it with 'you
   never know what lurks in the dark'.

...when going into a room or getting off an elevator, you run in and out
   quickly to see what follows you out.

...you don't worry so much about getting hurt, since you'll probably pick
   up one of those blue spheres somewhere.

...watching someone come out of an elevator makes your mouse finger twitch

...when the dog growls and you dive over the couch while
   reaching for a shotgun.

...when you start side-stepping into rooms.

...when you push on a wall as you walk down the hall looking for secret
   entrances

...when you rush for a neon-blue down vest in K-Mart

...when you reach for your chainsaw when your wife's cold
   gives her the sniffles

...when you search for a radiation suit before going into
   a swimming pool

...when you instinctively target trash cans while walking
   around campus/work

...when you look for sniper spots above you when getting in an elevator.

...when you can't stop squinting as you walk around your house

...when you think you can actually walk through walls

...when you start making chainsaw noises if you hear a strange noise.

...when you wish you had a chainsaw, just in case.

...when you buy a radiation suit and Infra-red goggles, just in case.

CHAPTER [2]: Top Ten Lists
--------------------------

        Here, humorous top ten lists regarding DOOM are written.
Actually, this is a lie.  Some of the lists have more than ten things.
However, for the sake of simplicity, I call them top ten lists.

[2-1]: Top Ten Things to Do While Waiting for DOOM
==================================================
        FOREWORD:  This was posted on America Online, by someone
using the name "Wolkonsky" on August 27, 1993.

----------
        Well, here we are waiting another 2-3 months [for DOOM].  What else
can we do?

1) Search the Internet for Beta Version.
2) See if we can go through Wolfenstein 3-D with our eyes closed.
3) Use MapEdit/WolfEdit to make Wolfenstein 3-D "look like" DOOM.
4) Find out where the id "lab" is and "encourage" them.
5) Watch the new 90210 episode!
6) See if Blake Stone or Rampage will be any good.
7) Upload the Lemmings Demo as "DOOM10.ZIP" and see what happens.
8) Get girlfriends and drop them on 12/10/93, unless they like DOOM and
   have a computer with a modem.
9) Or lastly, look at DOOM slides and "pretend" we are playing.
----------

[2-2]: Top Ten Things To Do Until DOOM Arrives
==============================================
        FOREWORD:  This was posted on America Online, by someone
using the name "ScottBro" on October 7, 1993.

----------
                          Top  10  Things  To Do
                           Until  DOOM  arrives

10.  Get a marker and change boxes of George Lucas's "LOOM" to "DOOM" to
     confuse over-anxious gamers.
9.   Issue bogus press release from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist,
     saying the DOOMsday clock will strike midnight sometime before
     September 30, 1993.
8.   Get a date with someone from L7.
7.   When feeling depressed due to the wait, chant the B.J. Blaskowitz mantra,
     "This is my rifle, This is my gun,
      This is for killing, this is for fun.
6.   Memorize the July Computer Gaming World, pages 104-5, preview of DOOM.
5.   Get network and sound card installed on all systems at the office.
4.   Make DOOM acronyms, like
     "Dantes Obsessive Outrageous Marauders"
3.   Tell boss I'll need two weeks vacation on very short notice during the
     third quarter, due to pending family crisis.
2.   Figure a way to persuade Id to allow imports of faces on monsters, so
     we can make creatures like the:
     Sunnunu Bloated Beast, the Michael Bolton Shrieker, and the Ex-Wife
     from Hell, where she belongs.
1.   Try and make friends with the Big Blue guys from Wolfie;
     We might need help this time.
----------

[2-3]: Top Ten Things Being Removed From DOOM During Delay
==========================================================
        FOREWORD:  This was posted on America Online, by someone
using the name "Wolkonsky" on August 31, 1993.

----------
        The DOOM Delay of `93 might be worse than we first thought! Here is
a list of things that I heard were being taken out of DOOM.

1) Socks the Cat
2) Cameo by the Mario Brothers (you thought the Pac-Man Ghosts were bad)
3) The "Shawngreen" monster in level 3 (too scary, it went around screaming
   "Its not done yet! Not yet!")
4) Cindy Crawford workout in level 4
5) Vanilla Ice-Amy Grant theme song
6) "Fun with Barney" puzzle in level 2
7) Pin Up GIF of Sally Struthers.
8) "John 3:15" : various locations
9) "Bulges" in monsters groin area
        AND FINALLY,
10) The Bathroom Scenes.

[2-3]: Top Twenty Comments Made After DOOM's Release
====================================================
        FOREWORD: This dream was posted by Michael Pemberton on Usenet in
the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Saturday, December 11, 1993.

----------
        For those of you who just don't have the time to read the voluminous
number of postings which are destined to appear about DOOM over the next two
weeks or so, I offer the following list which should summarize the gist of
those postings.  Out of courtesy to others, I suggest that posters review
this list, include the appropriate number in their subject headers, and allow
others to select the postings they wish to read with some foreknowledge of
their contents.

Those who wish to add to this list may do so; if interest continues, I will
post updated versions for the convenience of all.

1)  DOOM is the greatest, bitchenest, most radical game of all time.  I
loved it.  I've played it for forty hours non-stop, only stopping for
periodic caffeine breaks, and I plan to play it for at least forty hours
more before collapsing into a quivering mass of protoplasm.  Go DOOM!  Go
DOOM!  Yaaaaaaaaaay!

2)  DOOM sucks!  Heehh-heeeh.  Heehhh-heeeeh.  Heehh-heeh.

3)  Hey, ID!  When you said that you were going to get DOOM out on the
10th, everyone thought that meant it would show up on sites at 12:01 AM.
If you knew there was going to be a delay, why didn't you have the courtesy
to tell us?

4)  When is DOOM II coming out?

5)  What's DOOM?

6)  Everyone's talking about this DOOM thing, but I can't find it on my
site anywhere.  I even tried the 127.0.0.1 site that someone recommended,
but it's not there either.  What gives?

7)  When I tried running DOOM on my IBM XT, it wouldn't play.  Is this a
bug?

8)  DOOM's not so hot because [choose one]: (a) The graphics are too dark,
(b) it's too slow on my AT, (c) it's too fast on my Pentium/66, (d) it's
too bloody and violent, (e) it's not bloody and violent enough, (f) it's
too hard to set up, (g) it takes too much memory to run, (h) there should
be a lot more weapons available early in the game, (i) Duke Nukem II is a
lot more fun.

9)  Compared to DOOM, Blake Stone is a wimpy piece of crap.

10)  Compared to Blake Stone; DOOM is a wimpy piece of crap.

11)  Anyone wonder how much money ID is going to make off this game?

12)  What's the big deal?  DOOM is just a rehash of Wolfenstein, and I got
tired of playing that weeks ago.

13)  Hey, I played DOOM for about 80 hours over the last couple of weeks
and I'm giving copies of it to all my relatives for Christmas, but I'm not
going to BUY it from ID because [choose one]: (a) ID's making too much
money anyway, (b) forty dollars is way out of line for a game like this,
(c) I couldn't figure out how to get into that area with the blue face, and
I don't think games should be this hard, (d) what good is a game you can
only play for a few hundred hours?, (e) I can get it from that computer
geek down the hall for free anyway.

14) Would someone post a map showing all the secret areas in DOOM?

15)  Would someone uuencode DOOM and post it here?

16)  Where are the rockets, chainguns, armor enhancers, medkits, ammo
boxes, [you name it] in the [name an area]?

17) What are the cheat keys for the shareware version of DOOM?

18) What do you mean there are no cheat keys for the shareware version of
DOOM?  I think that ID shows a real lack of respect for its potential
customers by taking out the shareware cheat keys.

19)  DOOM was way overhyped.

20)  DOOM lived up to its publicity and our expectations.

21)  There I was, playing DOOM, and suddenly I was dropped out of the game
with an "Out of hunk" error.  What sloppy programming!

22)  Shame on ID for releasing a game that is still so full of bugs (even
though I haven't found any yet)!  They're as bad as Origin!

23)  A hearty thanks to Hank Leukart, Jay Wilbur, and everyone else at ID
for being so supportive and tolerant of sometimes-whiney, sometimes-
impatient, but almost always appreciative gameplayers (like me) who love to
see excellent games like this one succeed.

CHAPTER [3]: DOOM R.E.M.
------------------------

        David Reeve Sward suggested that I add a section in the FAQ
for people who have been dreaming about DOOM while sleeping.  I told him
it was crazy until three people posted messages about having "DOOM Dreams."
Here they are, pixelated and all!

[3-1]: Pixelated Demons

A few days ago I awoke in the middle of a dream about DOOM...!  I was
firing the shotgun at a pixelated (yes, my dream was pixelated) demon
when my alarm clock went off (well, it turned the radio on :).  Haven't
seen any alpha or beta version, only the screen shots.  Time to schedule
an appointment with a local shrink...

I can't imagine what shape I'll be in once the game is actually released :).

Strange enough, I had a dream about DOOM last evening, too.  I dreamt that I
had found the mythical beta release version lying around on a FTP site,
downloaded it, and actually got to play it before anyone else.  Now, I know
I could just do this anyways, but I have too many morals.
What are you doing to us, Jay, now we're DREAMING about getting
DOOM... SIGH..

        While you all were dreaming, I was having some serious nightmares.
DOOM was released early and I went down to buy it ASAP.  When I opened my
wallet, it was empty.  And they wouldn't accept credit or personal checks...
I spent the rest of the night trying to scrounge up the cash to buy it.
It was not a pretty sight!
