  DESIGN10.FAQ -- Frequently Asked Questions about DOOM Level Design
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0, 8 June 1994.       Editor: Tom Neff <tneff@panix.com> 
 
INTRODUCTION
------------
 
  This is a FAQ for DOOM level design in general, not how to use a
particular editor.  If you want to know about playing DOOM rather than
designing new levels for it, read the DOOM FAQ (see Appendix B).
 
  Designers should also get the Unofficial DOOM Specs (see Appendix B).
 
  Contributions to this document are welcome (see Appendix C).
 
  The sections below are: EDITORS, WALLS, SECTORS/ROOMS/FLOORS/CEILINGS,
DOORS, TAGS/TRIGGERS/EFFECTS, MONSTERS/THINGS, LEVEL MAPS,
GRAPHICS/SOUNDS, and OTHER ERRORS.  The Appendices are: THE 10 MOST
COMMON DESIGN ERRORS, GETTING ESSENTIAL FILES, CONTRIBUTING TO THIS
DOCUMENT, SOUNDS BY NUMBER, and SOME CURRENT LEVEL EDITORS. Questions
and paragraphs are numbered for reference.
 
 
1. EDITORS
----------
 
  [1-1] What's the best level editor?  Where can I get Editor X?
 
  A. Try them out and decide for yourself.  See Appendix E for a list of
the current popular editors.  They are all found on the primary DOOM FTP
sites, which are listed in Appendix B.
 
 
2. WALLS
--------
 
  [2-1] I flagged a two-sided wall Impassible, but monsters and players
can still shoot through it.  What's wrong?
 
  A. Two-sided walls don't stop bullets/fireballs, no matter what flag
bits you set.  To stop shots, you need either one-sided lines (void
space) or a floor-ceiling mismatch high enough to block the line of
sight.  "Impassible" only refers to motion by monsters or players.
 
-----
 
  [2-2] I set "Blocks Sound" on the lines surrounding a room, but monsters
still seem to hear me.  What's wrong?
 
  A. A sound you make will activate non-deaf monsters if they can hear it.
Your sound fills your sector completely (even if it has non-contiguous
"extents" - a potentially useful effect), then travels to sectors that
are are adjacent to the one you're in, and then to sectors adjacent to
those, and so on.  Sound will stop at one-sided lines, it will stop at
closed doors or other floor/ceiling cutoffs, and it will be "diminished"
at two sided lines which have the "blocks sound" bit set.  It takes TWO
(2) lines with "blocks sound" to stop the sound.  (This is confirmed by
the comments in ID's released DOOMBSP code.)
 
  So - place a thin "buffer sector" next to your room, with both lines
flagged "Blocks Sound," and monsters on the other side of the buffer
sector won't hear you.

-----
 
  [2-3] OK, I understand how sound blocking works and my monsters work
properly, but why can *I* can still hear everything (monsters, shots, 
lifts, etc), even across "Blocks Sound" lines?
 
  A. Sound blocking only affects monsters.  Human players can hear
everything possible (if there is a physical sound path) without regard
to line flags.  Sound does attenuate with distance, e.g., a distant lift
will sound faint to you, a near one loud.  (Monsters hear perfectly at
any distance.)
 
-----
 
  [2-4] I wanted to make a doorway that LOOKS like a wall, by taking a
passable two-sided line and giving it a Normal texture on one or both
sides.  Then you could walk/shoot through it, hide behind it, etc.  But
when I loaded my level and walked up to the secret wall, it looked like
weird colored strings, and my PC slowed to a crawl.  What's wrong?
 
  A. We call this the Medusa Effect - it looks like snakes and you turn
to stone. :-)  It happens because you used a *multi-patch* texture on
the Normal of your passwall.  A fuller explanation of patches and
textures can be found in the Unofficial Specs (see Appendix B), but
briefly, each texture (like STARTAN3) is built from one or more graphic
"patches" (like SW19_1 and SW19_2); and for some reason, DOOM's engine
can only draw SINGLE-patch textures on passable walls.  Examples of
single-patch textures (which you could use) are BROWNGRN, SKINTEK2, and
ASHWALL.  Examples of multi-patch textures that won't work are STARTAN3,
COMPBLUE, and WOODSKUL.  A complete list (TEXPATCH) of textures and the
patches that make them up is available on major DOOM archive sites (see
Appendix B).
 
-----
 
  [2-5] I got some strange colored dots and lines on some of my walls, but
I wasn't trying to make anything secret or strange.  My PC seems to run at
full speed and the walls function normally, but they look funny.  What
did I do?
 
  A. We call this Tutti Frutti effect (TFE).  It happens for one of two
reasons: either you used a short texture (less than 128 high) on a
taller wall, or you used a transparent texture (like MIDGRATE) on an
Upper or Lower surface, instead of the Normal surface.
 
  The "short texture TFE" happens because textures are only *vertically*
tiled on 128 pixel boundaries.  If your wall is taller than your texture
and the texture is less than 128 high, DOOM fills in the extra pixels
with quasi-random garbage, hence the colored tutti frutti.  You often
see this when designers put "STEPx" on 20-24 high steps.
 
  The "upper/lower holes TFE" happens because Upper and Lower surfaces
actually have *nothing* behind them, so DOOM has nothing to show through
the holes; hence random garbage or tutti frutti.
 
-----
 
  [2-6] A wall in my level looks strange - it seems to flash rapidly
with lots of overlapping textures and pictures from elsewhere in my
viewscreen.  What did I do wrong?
 
  A. This is the infamous Hall Of Mirrors (HOM) effect.  You omitted
a necessary texture: either the Normal of a one-sided line, or the
Upper/Lower of a side whose upper/lower surface is exposed to air.  Many
editors will catch this error nowadays, but you can still run into it in
the case where a lift or floor/ceiling movement exposes a surface that
was "originally" covered in the editor.  Note that there are two other
ways to get a limited HOM effect: see [8-1].  Those are DOOM engine
bugs, but missing-texture HOM is all your fault.
 
-----
 
  [2-7] There is a place in my level where the whole screen flashes for
a moment, usually black but sometimes in a pattern.  If you keep
walking, it vanishes.  What's wrong?
 
  A. That's the Flash Of Black (FOB) or "moire" error.  It's another
DOOM engine limit, triggered by going from one sector to another where
the ceiling (or floor) height difference is greater than about 1024.
It's harmless but disturbing.  There is no real workaround, except not
making such a huge transition in floor/ceiling heights if you can avoid
it.  (You could insert a couple of thin "doorway" sectors with ceilings
stepped up 512 at a time...) This is supposedly fixed in DOOM 1.4.
 
                        -- with material from Geoff Allan (DoomEd author)
 
 
3. SECTORS/ROOMS/FLOORS/CEILINGS
--------------------------------
 
  [3-1] Is it possible to make a two-story area, where you could walk
over or under a platform?
 
  A. Not really - that's a limit of the DOOM engine.  Only one sector can 
occupy a given spot on the (2-D) map.
 
  You can do some fairly convincing imitations, though.  Two- or
three-"story" buildings have been done, with transporters placed in the
middle of the "up"/"down" staircases.  Criss-crossing mazes on two or
three levels (see OCTAGON) have been done, where you jump over
"trenches" while running the upper levels.
 
  You can also make things that LOOK like floating platforms, even
though you can't go both over and under them.  Judicious use of F_SKY1,
uppers and lowers does the trick.
 
-----
 
  [3-2] I set a sector's type to Light Pulsates Smoothly, but it doesn't.
 
  A. First, some versions of some editors got the pulsating sector type
wrong.  It is type 8.  Second, the smooth pulsing goes from the initial
brightness level *DOWN TO* the lowest adjacent brightness, and then back
up.  If the type-8 sector is at or below the brightness of adjacent
sectors, nothing will happen.
 
 
4. DOORS
--------
 
  [4-1] I built a door in a high-walled room, and now the door texture
"repeats" all the way to the ceiling.  It's very ugly.  How do I get
rid of it?
 
  A. Recess the door.  Add a mini-"hall" leading from your main room,
with a lower ceiling height to match the texture height of your door, and
place the door in that.
 
        |
        +-+-+-------
        : |d|
  room  : |o|  hall
        : |o|
        : |r|
        +-+-+-------
        |
 
-----
 
  [4-2] I added a door but when I play the level, the door is already open,
and it makes an opening noise but it won't close.  What gives?
 
  A. It's hard to get this to happen.  You may have a Tag number set to
something inappropriate: for most Door types, it should be zero.  Make
sure the activating lines face "outward" (right side facing the player).
Most doors start out closed (floor = ceiling), but they don't have to.
 
  Note: Even if a door starts out partly open, it will still close all
the way (floor=ceiling).
 
-----
 
  [4-3] How can I keep monsters from opening a door?
 
  A. One way is by requiring one of the Keys (red/blue/yellow) to open
the door.  Monsters don't have keys.  Another way is by putting a thin
high step in front the door.  Monsters hate that.  Of course you could
mark it "monsters don't cross" but then they won't go through either way
even if it's open, which might not be the effect you want.
 
 
5. TAGS/TRIGGERS/EFFECTS
------------------------
 
  [5-1] I can't get my Tags to work right.  I put the sector number I
wanted into the Linedef...
 
  A. Hold it right there!  :-)  Tags are perhaps the most misunderstood
DOOM feature.   Tags are NOT sector numbers and they are NOT line
numbers!  They are *arbitrary* numbers, 1 to 32767, that are *shared* by
one or more lines and sectors, as a way of identifying the sectors as a
group.  It's just like being assigned a "box number" when you place a
newspaper classified ad.  You say, Here's my ad, and they give you Box
78, which happened to be unused.  78 bears no relationship to you
personally, it's just the place where replies to your ad will be sent.
Similarly, if you set up an effect like "lights out," with a walk-over
line to trigger it and a set of one or more sectors whose lights you
want to go out, the actual *numbers* of the lines and sectors don't
matter.  You pick an unused Tag number out of thin air -- say #7 is free
-- and you plug that Tag number into *both* the trigger line (or lines)
and the affected sector (or sectors).  Then later, when you walk over
that line, DOOM says oh, that had Tag #7, now where are all the Tag #7
sectors?  and when it finds them, whatever their actual sector numbers,
it turns out their lights.
 
-----
 
  [5-2] Then what's a Platform?
 
  A. Nothing -- as far as DOOM is concerned, that is.  This isn't an
editor-specific document, but one package added somewhat to the Tag
confusion by (mis-)renaming them "Platforms" (which sounds like a raised
floor, but isn't) and giving them textual descriptions, as if "Lava
Lift" were all you needed to know.  But Tags can be used in complex and
interesting ways: several groups of lines can perform different effects
on the same group of Tagged sectors, for example.  If your editor limits
how you can use the powerful Tags facility, ask the author to change it.
 
 
6. MONSTERS/THINGS
------------------
 
  [6-1] I built a hallway/room that my monsters refuse to enter.  They
stamp around at the entrance but that's it.
 
  A. Make sure your hall is wide and tall enough!  The Unofficial
Specs [4-2-1] has a list of monster heights and widths.  What's more, if
a hall is *just* wide enough for a monster, it's less likely to enter
than if it's *plenty* wide enough.
 
  Also be careful about step-downs and step-ups.  Monsters will not step
up/down too far onto narrow steps.  If you want a monster to go up or
down more than 16, make sure there's plenty of room on both sides of the
riser line.
 
-----
 
  [6-2] I put some demons in a room but they don't move, they just stand
there and twitch, although they scream when I shoot them.  How did that
happen?
 
  A. You probably placed them too close together when you laid out your
level.  Monsters have to be separated from each other (AND from nearby
walls) by at least their own width, or they freeze in place.  (If you
kill all of a monster's too-close neighbors, it will usually free the
monster to attack you.)
 
  The other possibility is that your ceiling is too low.  See the
Unofficial DOOM Specs (Appendix B) for monster widths and heights.
 
 
7. LEVEL MAPS
-------------
 
  [7-1] When I play my level and switch to Map mode, it only shows me a
little bit of the local area I'm in, even when I hit "-" a lot or "0" to
Zoom Out.  The Id levels seem to work OK and some of the levels I've
downloaded do too.  What am I doing wrong?
 
  A. The culprit is the resource called BLOCKMAP.  It is described in
the Unofficial Specs [4-11].  Some editors don't build a good one.  You
can usually overcome this by creating a few dummy "sectorlets" or just
linedefs out at the "corners" outside of your real level map area.
Otherwise, you'll have turn Follow off and scroll around the map.
 
-----
 
  [7-2] I designed a level that's about as complicated as one of the 
original ID levels - roughly the same number of rooms, monsters, etc.  
But mine plays much *slower* than the originals!  What's wrong?
 
  A. There is a resource called REJECT that quickly tells DOOM whether
sectors can "see" each other, allowing many expensive line-of-sight
checks to be skipped.  Without REJECT, DOOM must constantly check each
monster to see whether it has a line of sight to your location.  On a
level with a lot of monsters, this can be time consuming.
 
  As of this writing, no DOOM level editor generates a real REJECT
resource, although two standalone programs (IDBSP and REJECT10) will
attempt to build one for your level.  See Appendix E.
 
 
8. GRAPHICS/SOUNDS
------------------
 
  [8-1] Some of these DOOM levels I download have custom graphics.  How
can I do that?
 
  A. If you can create or find a GIF file of the right size, there is a
utility called DMGRAPH (see Appendix E) that will insert it into your
WAD file.  You are on your own as far as picking a Windows or DOS based
graphics editor -- there are a lot of them, preferences vary widely, and
if you've never made a picture before, you're probably not ready to use
them in your DOOM levels.  Once you have a picture, the DMGRAPH
documentation tells you more about how to use it.
 
-----
 
  [8-2] I wanted to change STARTAN3, but when I ran the DMGRAPH utility,
it said "entry not found."  What's wrong?
 
  A. As described in the Unofficial Specs (see Appendix B), textures are
built out of graphic "patches."  DMGRAPH 1.1 (the latest version at this
writing) only deals with patches, which have their own names.  STARTAN3
is a texture name.  A few textures are composed of exactly one "patch,"
allowing you to do a full substitution, but others are built of three or
five or more "patches."  A future version of DMGRAPH may (or may not)
address this situation.
 
-----
 
  [8-3] I can change the wall graphics just fine, but when I try to
change a floor or ceiling, DOOM crashes.  What am I doing wrong?
 
  A. Not much, unfortunately.  As the DMGRAPH documentation points out,
only some kinds of graphic patches can be supplied in PWAD files.
Floors, ceilings and sprites (Imp, Torches etc) cannot.  The only thing
you can do is patch them in the *original* DOOM.WAD file.  You could
supply the GIFs, a copy of DMGRAPH and a batch file along with your
custom level, so that the user can insert the graphics him/herself, but
many users don't like patching their main WAD file.
 
-----
 
  [8-4] I got a utility (DMAUD) that replaces DOOM sounds, but I don't
know what numbers go with what sounds, and the Unofficial Specs don't
say.  What are the various sound names?
 
  A. This should be added to the Unofficial Specs but hasn't yet.  Nor
it there a dedicated separate file uploaded to FTP sites, that I've
seen.  So I've included the table as Appendix D.  The source (I don't
know if also the author) was Bob Craycroft.
 
 
9. OTHER ERRORS
---------------
 
  [9-1] I have a level that passes all my editor's consistency checks, and
looks clean to me, but when I play it, I get strange flashing effects on
a few of the walls, what I think they call "Hall of Mirrors."  What's
wrong?
 
  A. First, make sure you built a good node tree with the BSP utility.
(See Appendix B for where to get it.) If you used BSP and it still
happens, and you're *sure* you didn't omit any required textures, you
may have hit a DOOM engine limit.
 
  The first limit is how many two-sided lines you can look across.  (Not
how many are in a room overall, but how many you can actually shoot an
arrow across in a given direction.)  If you gaze across more than about
16 (sixteen) two-sided lines, you will probably see the Hall of Mirrors
(HOM) effect somewhere in the room.  It might not be in the direction of
the 2S lines, but somewhere on the edge of the picture.  If you hit this
limit, find a way to simplify your room's layout or interpose some void
space (one-sided lines) so you can't look across so many 2S's.
 
  The second limit has to do with looking at superlong lines.  If you
have a line that's longer than about 1024 units, break it up by
inserting vertexes in the middle.  Id's own E1M8 (outside the "star" in
the courtyard) demonstrates this limit.
 
 
APPENDIX A.  THE 10 MOST COMMON DESIGN ERRORS
---------------------------------------------
 
Some of these are show-stoppers, i.e., DOOM will crash if you try to run
the level; others will let you run DOOM but game play is screwed up;
others are just ugly; and a few are common stylistic complaints.  All
are encountered often in user-written levels, or asked about in
discussion forums, or both.  There is no particular order.
 
  [A-1] Bad Wall Effects.  This includes HOM (Hall Of Mirrors), caused
by missing textures (see [1-7]); Medusa Effect, caused by incorrect
Normal textures on 2-sided walls (see [1-5]); Tutti Frutti, caused
by short Normal or transparent Upper/Lower textures (see [1-6]); and
FOB (Flash of Black) or "moire", caused by huge changes in ceiling
height (see [1-8]).
 
  [A-2] Wall Pegging.  Wall faces exposed by rising/lowering ceilings or
floors (including door side tracks) should usually have the Unpegged
Lower/Upper bits set in their Linedef.  This keeps the side textures
from "following" the adjacent rising/lowering sector.  Many, many user
level designers forget to unpeg their door tracks.  Just cosmetic, but
contributes to the sense of realism or lack thereof.
 
  [A-3] Lines/Vertexes that Cross or Coincide.  A show-stopper.  If two
or more vertexes occupy the same position, or if two or more lines
cross or lie "on top of" one another, DOOM's engine will crash trying to
work out the sector math.  Several editors are capable of checking for
this; if you get crashes, use one.
 
  [A-4] Slowdown from Monster/Two-Sided Line Glut.  Not a crash but a
playability issue.  See [6-2].  Designers should try their levels on
less powerful PC's and/or at full screen resolution to see whether some
rooms are unacceptably slow.
 
  [A-5] Unaligned Textures, both X and Y.  Just cosmetic, but important
for realism.  If your X textures are properly aligned and you split a
line or drag vertexes around, you will probably need to re-align.  A
tedious job, but some editors help automate it for you.  (But note: It's
considered polite to offset secret door textures a little bit -- say 2
pixels -- just enough so that an attentive player might notice it.)
 
  [A-6] Missing Player Starts, Insufficient Sectors.  Another
show-stopper.  Every level must have a minimum of two (2) sectors.  It
must also have a Player 1 Start if you are going to play non-Deathmatch;
Players 2-4 Start if you will be playing Cooperative multiplayer; and
four (4) Deathmatch starts if you will be playing Deathmatch.  Otherwise
DOOM will crash.
 
  [A-7] Floor/Ceiling Mismatch.  Usually caused by raising/lowering a
floor but forgetting the associated ceiling, or vice versa.  Sometimes
caused by accidentally "including" an unintended sector in a
floor/ceiling change, under editors that support multi sector
"gang" operations.  Unless the ceiling is at least 56 higher than the
floor, you either can't enter or (if you are already there, via
teleport, floor/ceiling movement or start of play) you will be stuck.
This is sometimes an issue on stairs: the LOWER ceiling must be at least
56 higher than the HIGHER floor, or you cannot pass between two sectors.
 
  [A-8] Missing/Wrong Tag Numbers.  When tagged operations like Lights
Out or Raise Floor get the tag number wrong (in the activating Linedef),
the results are usually awful.  The whole level "rises" or crushes or
something else you don't want.  This can be tough to spot at first in
gameplay.  Ideally, editors should check for this.
 
  [A-9] Monsters Too Close To Each Other or to Walls.  See [5-2].   You
must also be careful to place Deathmatch and multi-player Start points
far enough from walls, or arriving players will be immobilized.
 
  [A-10] Dead End Pits.  Perhaps a stylistic argument, but at least be
AWARE of which places (if any) on your level have "no escape" for the
unwary user who enters.  ID's original levels do have a couple of these,
but many users don't like them.
 
 
APPENDIX B.  GETTING ESSENTIAL FILES
------------------------------------
 
  The most essential document for level designers is the Unofficial DOOM
Specs (currently 1.3, to be updated to 1.4 after DOOM 1.4 is released),
written by Matt Fell (matt.burnett@acebbs.com) and distributed by Hank
Leukart (ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu).  The next most important is the
DOOM FAQ itself, also from Hank Leukart, and currently at 5.6.
 
  Both documents are widely distributed on the various DOOM BBS's,
Usenet newsgroups, game boards of online services, and anonymous FTP
sites supporting DOOM players.  The Unofficial Specs are usually stored
as DMSPEC13.ZIP and the DOOM FAQ is DMFAQ56.ZIP.  Some services may use
slightly different names.
 
  Other useful documents include TEXPATCH.ZIP, a list of texture names
and the graphic patches that make them up.
 
  A list of WAD editors and utilities appears in Appendix E.
 
  Where to get this stuff?  Try one of the following FTP sites:
 
    ftp.uwp.edu               /pub/incoming/id
                              /pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew/doom
    wuarchive.wustl.edu       /pub/msdos_uploads/games/doomstuff
    infant2.sphs.indiana.edu  /pub/doom/wad_edit
 
 
APPENDIX C.  CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DOCUMENT
------------------------------------------
 
  If you have a correction, contribution or suggestion, please mail it
to me, the editor, at one of these addresses:
 
    tneff@panix.com           (Internet)
    uunet!panix!tneff             (UUCP)

or any other Internet mail gateway you can reach.  I will
read all submissions and (if I use them) credit the author.
 
  Remember, this is a level design FAQ for things that users really ask.
It is not for product advertisements, jumbo ASCII graphics, opera
librettos, or other noise.  If you have discovered something new and
interesting about DOOM, mail it to Matt Fell for the next Specs.  I only
want material that answers frequent design questions.
