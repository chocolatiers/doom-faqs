                         Introduction

        iD Software's DOOM is truly the Killer App of the MS-DOS
   world. DOOM's popularity is so immense, it has been estimated
   that DOOM is installed on more PCs than OS/2 and Windows NT
   combined, and DOOM's creators commute to work in Ferarri
   Testarossas. Interest in the game has been so great that it has
   been hacked, reverse-engineered, dissected, and enhanced more
   than any other game in PC history. And now, as more and more
   people become hooked into the Internet, DOOM is rapidly becoming
   the Killer App of the Internet, as well.

        Internet DOOM play is currently at the "clever hack" stage.
   DOOM, as released by iD, supports only IPX network play and
   serial play between two machines. As a result, the DOOM
   documentation doesn't include any information about DOOMing
   across the net. Of course, this also means that DOOMers can't
   call id for help. The result of all this is many curious people
   asking the same question: How do I play DOOM over the Internet?
   Enter this document. In the pages that follow, we will attempt to
   answer the most frequently asked questions about iDOOM, including
   what you need, how to set it up, and how to find new fragbait -
   er, I mean, opponents.

        DOOM across the Internet is made possible by a neat little
   freeware program called iDOOM. iDOOM uses the UDP protocol (part
   of the TCP/IP protocol suite) to send DOOM game information
   between multiple machines on the Internet. It is based on the
   WATTCP TCP/IP kernel written by Eric Engelke of the University of
   Waterloo. By some strange coincidence, the authors of this
   document are also the creators of iDOOM, and we have used the
   program to play Internet DOOM sessions with opponents from as far
   away as Estonia. In writing this FAQ, we hope that sharing some
   of our experience will make it easier for you to get connected in
   your own Internet DOOM sessions. NOTE: Throughout this document,
   we will refer specifically to games of DOOM played over the
   Internet via a DIRECT CONNECTION, i.e. no modems are involved
   anywhere in the link. Note that IHHD, SLIP and PPP connections
   all involve modems at some point. Although other methods of
   connecting two DOOM machines together across the Internet exist,
   this document will focus on direct net connections using the
   iDOOM network driver program.



                        Getting Prepared

   Q1: I want to play DOOM over the Internet using iDOOM. What
   hardware do I need?

        To successfully play DOOM across the Internet, you will need
   the following hardware:

        * A machine capable of playing DOOM (D'OHH!) 

        * An ethernet card. And not just any old ethernet card, mind 
        you - your ethernet card must be supported by a packet
        driver if you wish to use it to play Internet DOOM. This
        document assumes that your PC is already equipped with a
        functional ethernet card, although it may currently be in
        use for some other non-TCP/IP function (such as a node on a
        Novell network).

        * A direct connection to the Internet. If there is a modem
        somewhere in the link between your PC and your opponent's
        PC, this FAQ is not for you. Although it is possible to play
        Internet DOOM over a modem link (either by dialing up to a
        UNIX machine and using IHHD or via SLIP/PPP), such
        connection methods are beyond the scope of this document.  

        * A MicroSoft-compatible mouse. OK, OK - so you don't REALLY
        need a mouse to play iDOOM, but it does help you turn more
        quickly, aim more accurately, and STOMP your keyboard-only
        Internet DOOM opponents... ;-)

              
   
   Q2: OK, I've got all the hardware. What software do I need?
                  
        In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is
   also required to round out your the package. Before you can play,
   you'll need to pick up the following:
   
        * DOOM 1.2 or higher (1.666 is STRONGLY recommended, since
        this version seems to have solved some problems related to
        initializing network games). DOOM versions 1.1 and below are
        incapable of using iDOOM.
   
        * A packet driver written specifically for your ethernet
        card. The Packet Driver is what lets iDOOM (and therefore
        DOOM) "talk" to your ethernet card.
   
        * iDOOM.EXE, the Internet driver for DOOM.  
        
        * The WATTCP Applications (not absolutely necessary, but can
        definitely be useful for debugging and testing your setup).

   
   Q3: Hold it - I don't have some of this software! Where can I get
   it?
   
        * To obtain iDOOM: Log on to ftp.vet.uga.edu via anonymous
        ftp. Change to directory /pub/doom. Download the file
        IDOOM10.ZIP. Version 1.0 is the latest version of iDOOM as
        of this writing. 
   
        * Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet
        drivers on a utilities diskette packaged with the card. If
        your card does not come with a packet driver, there is an
        excellent collection of freely available packet drivers
        called the Crynwr (nee Clarkson) Packet Driver collection.
        You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu.
        Change to the /pub/msdos/pktdrvr subdirectory and download
        PKTD11.ZIP and PKTD11C.ZIP. The files PKTD11A.ZIP and
        PKTD11B.ZIP contain source code for the packet drivers and
        example programs - you won't need these in order to play
        iDOOM.
   
        * To obtain the WATTCP applications, ftp to
        dorm.rutgers.edu, change to the /pub/msdos/wattcp/
        subdirectory, and download file APPS.ZIP.
                  
   Q4: OK, I've got everything, now what do I do to set it up?
   
        Setting your computer up for TCP/IP access is very
   straightforward. As an illustration, I'll be taking you through
   the steps necessary to set up a PC with an SMC ethernet card and
   the IP address 128.192.23.5. You'll of course need to substitute
   your own specific information in place of the examples given
   here. All set? OK, let's get started.
   
        Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible. This
   includes such things as memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386, QEMM,
   etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI). DOOM doesn't need
   the former, and the latter will probably conflict with the packet
   driver. We recommend that you prepare a boot floppy with a
   CONFIG.SYS containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT
   containing only prompt=$p$g.
   
        Step 1: Set up the packet driver.
        Determine your ethernet card's IRQ setting, it's base I/O
   port setting, and it's memory address setting (if any). You
   should be able to determine this by looking at the card itself
   and consulting the user manual. You'll need some if not all of
   this information, depending upon which packet driver you use.
   Unzip the appropriate driver from Crynwr Packet Driver collection
   archive. In our example case, the packet driver is called
   SMC_WD.COM. By looking at the jumpers on the card and consulting
   the manual, I determined that the card has been set to IRQ 7,
   Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory address is at
   segment d800h. For this example, I have chosen to use interrupt
   60h for the packet driver. Packet drivers typically operate on an
   interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing
   else in my sample system happens to be using the first available
   interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that. Thus, to load my packet
   driver, I use the following command line:
   
   SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800
   
   where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
   on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is
   the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
   notation). Don't worry if you don't understand what all this
   stuff means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet
   driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a
   Novell network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
   parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG,
   usually located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT
   subdirectories (along with all the other drivers needed by
   Novell). 
   
        At the very minimum, the packet driver should give a sign on
   message and report the ethernet address of your NIC (Network
   Interface Card) when you load it. Chances are that if your
   ethernet card has been functioning properly for other tasks (e.g.
   as a node on a Novell network) then you'll have no problems here. 
   If not, or if there are any error or warning messages, something
   is wrong. One possibility is that one of the settings on your
   ethernet card is in conflict with those of another adapter card
   in your system. No two adapter cards can have the same IRQ, I/O
   port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory areas of two
   cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll need to correct the
   problem before continuing.
   
        Step 2: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file. 
        Your WATTCP.CFG file contains important parameters used by
   the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel. These values MUST be entered correctly
   if you wish to make a connection with another DOOM PC. In
   preparation for this, you'll need several bits of information.
   Contact the network administrator for your site and find out the
   IP address for your machine, the IP address for your gateway or
   router, the IP address of at least one Domain Name Server local
   to your site, and your netmask value. The three IP addresses will
   each consist of four groups of digits separated by periods. In
   our example, the machine's IP address is 128.192.23.5, the
   gateway is 128.192.23.1, the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the
   nameserver address is 128.192.44.67. NOTE: it is important to use
   the numeric IP addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you
   have other Internet programs currently installed on your machine,
   such as Gopher or the Trumpet newsreader, you can probably get
   the information you need from the configuration files you need
   for those programs (some will even use their own WATTCP.CFG, in
   which case you can simply copy it over to your DOOM directory).

        When you have collected all this information, unzip the
   IDOOM10.ZIP file in your DOOM directory. Use your favorite ASCII
   text editor to edit the file called WATTCP.CFG. Edit or add the
   following lines in WATTCP.CFG:
   
   my_ip=
   gateway=
   nameserver=
   netmask=
   
   On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file looks like this:
   my_ip=128.192.23.5
   gateway=128.192.23.1
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   nameserver=128.192.44.67
   
   Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.
   
   
        If you know your machine's IP address, but you can't find
   out the other values, you can often get away with some educated
   guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet usually has an
   IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our example. Thus,
   if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting your gateway's
   IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet mask, a common
   value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. In some cases, the
   gateway value can be something like xxx.yyy.1.1 with a
   corresponding netmask value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work,
   it can't hurt to try the other. Finally, if you don't know your
   nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by without it for
   the purposes of DOOM playing. Since you'll be specifying IP
   addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a nameserver
   lookup won't be necessary to resolve their addresses. 
   
        Step 3: Test your TCP/IP setup.
        Load your packet driver with the appropriate interrupt, IRQ,
   I/O and memory addresses. Next, unzip the TCPINFO and PING
   programs from the WATTCP apps archive into your DOOM directory.
   At the DOS prompt, type:
   
             TCPINFO    
   
   and press the <Enter> key. If your WATTCP.CFG values are set up
   correctly, and if your packet driver and net connection are
   functional, you'll see a couple of screens of information about
   your system, including your ethernet address and the parameters
   you specified in the WATTCP.CFG file. 
   
        If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING
   program to attempt to establish contact with your subnet gateway.
   At the DOS prompt, type
   
        PING <yourgateway's.numeric.ip.address>
   
   and press the <Enter> key. After a brief delay, you should see a 
   message telling you that the host is responding, as well as the
   round trip time for PING's test packets. If you see the "Timeout"
   error message, then something is wrong with your setup; if your
   PC is unable to reach your gateway, it will be unable to reach
   the rest of the Internet, as well. For our sample system, we
   would type:
   
             ping 128.192.23.1
   
        If your gateway PING was successful, try PINGing your Domain
   Name Server (at the IP address you specified in WATTCP.CFG) as
   well as some well-known site on the internet (e.g. infant2, which
   is at IP address 129.79.234.115). These will test your machine's
   ability to connect with other machines outside of your subnet as
   well as those outside of your site. All of these PINGs should
   result in a "host responding" message with a response time. If
   any of these attempts fails, recheck your entries in WATTCP.CFG
   and/or get some help from your network administrator. Examples
   for our test system:
   
        ping 128.192.44.67
   
   and

        ping 129.79.234.115


             Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play!

        OK, if you've made it this far, you're now ready for the
   main event: an actual game of DOOM! For this first attempt, it's
   best to try and find someone on your local network who's willing
   to put in a little frag time with you. Connections on your local
   net will be faster and less problematic, whereas if you attempt
   as long distance connection your first time out, you'll have a
   hard time discerning problems caused by distance from problems
   caused by an incorrect configuration.

        In general, the players will decide beforehand which machine
   will be machine #1, which will be #2, which will be #3, and so
   on. Then each machine's command line follows the format

   iDOOM [game options] -net <machine_number> <IP_addresses>

        The IP addresses MUST appear in order, i.e. machine #1's IP
   address must appear FIRST in ALL command lines. Machine #2's IP
   address must appear SECOND, and so on. The final piece to the
   puzzle is that each machine leaves it's own IP address out of the
   list. The result is a set of command lines like the following:

   iDOOM [options] -net 1 <machine2> <machine3> <machine4>
   iDOOM [options] -net 2 <machine1> <machine3> <machine4>
   iDOOM [options] -net 3 <machine1> <machine2> <machine4>
   iDOOM [options] -net 4 <machine1> <machine2> <machine3>

        Note that machine1, machine2, machine3, and machine4 are the
   numeric IP addresses of each respective machine in the iDOOM
   session.

        In our example scenario, the computer is part of a local
   area network in a computer lab. Thus, there are identical
   machines sitting immediately beside my test machine, with IP
   addresses one off from my own, i.e. the test machine has IP
   address 128.192.23.5, the machine to the right has IP address
   128.192.23.6, and the one to the left is 128.192.23.4. After
   stepping through the basic configuration process outlined above
   on the other test machines, my frag buddies and I are ready to
   begin. On my machine, which we decided will be machine #1, I
   type:

   iDOOM -deathmatch -net 1 128.192.23.6 128.192.23.4

   The guy to my right, whose machine is #2 and whose IP address is
   128.192.23.6, types:

   iDOOM -deathmatch -net 2 128.192.23.5 128.192.23.4

   And finally the guy to my left (machine #3, IP address
   128.192.23.4) types:

   iDOOM -deathmatch -net 3 128.192.23.5 128.192.23.6

        After we all hit <ENTER>, our machines display "Looking for
   a Node..." then "Found a Node!" and after that the usual DOOM
   startup information. Shortly thereafter, the screen melts away
   and there we are, in E1M1, pistols at the ready!

        Give your buddies a good thrashing - you've earned it! Now,
   after you've gotten DOOM working on your own subnet, you're ready
   for the final step. Find a partner who is also capable of playing
   Internet DOOM. Watch the posts in alt.games.doom, or tune into
   the #doom, #tcpdoom or #iDOOM channels on irc. You and he will
   negotiate game parameters, such as which map to play, which skill
   level, and so on. You'll also decide on who will be -net 1 and
   who will be -net 2 (experienced DEATHMATCHers will often try very
   hard to avoid being -net 1, since that player's uniform is
   colored day-glo green and is easier to spot in a DEATHMATCH). Now
   simply add the parameters you've agreed on to the iDOOM command
   line you used before, making sure that the -net <n> <etc.> is the
   LAST thing on the command line, and that the entire command line
   does NOT exceed the 128 character limit imposed by DOS. A typical
   command line will look something like

   iDOOM -skill 5 -nomonsters -deathmatch -net 2 128.192.55.666


                   Oh Oh - It's Not Working!

        OK, so you've done everything, just like I've shown you, but
   you're still having problems. The following are some suggestions
   to try in case of trouble.

        Q: My machine keeps looking for a node forever.
        A: iDOOM searches for other game nodes in a very specific
   way: It starts searching for the LAST player first, and then
   works its way backward. Thus, if you try to start a 4 player net
   game, but the 4th player has problems, NOBODY will find ANYBODY
   ELSE. This behavior can be very misleading and confusing to those
   caught unawares.

        Q: I keep seeing this ICMP: port unreachable message on my
   screen.
   
        A: This message is generated by the other machine when the
   port being requested by the sender is unavailable (in use) by the
   destination. I've seen this happen in some cases when I started
   looking for a node before the other player did. Once the other
   player began looking for a node also, the ICMP: messages went
   away, and the game linked up normally. If you see this message,
   you might also want to try using a different port (see the iDOOM
   documentation on the -port command line parameter).

        Q: The music starts up fine, but all I see is a BSOD (Black
   Screen of Death).
        Q: My machine displays "sending network start info" or
   "listening for network start info" and then locks up.
        A: iDOOM uses UDP packets to exchange game information
   between all machines in the game. UDP packets are not guaranteed
   to reach their destination, and there is no mechanism for the
   sender to even be informed that what he sent never made to the
   destination machine. DOOM has its own internal error detection
   and correction schemes, so this ordinarily isn't a problem -
   EXCEPT, apparently, at game startup. For whatever reason, DOOM
   appears to be extremely vulnerable to dropped packets during the
   game startup arbitration. This can result in some machines
   getting as far as "sending network start info" but never getting
   a response (if the response packet was lost) or in a node
   "listening for network start info" forever, since the network
   start info packet fell into a bit bucket somewhere along the way.
   One thing to do is make sure that you're waiting long enough
   before giving up and declaring your machine locked. In some
   cases, especially those involving multiple players and/or long
   distances, it can take quite some time for all machines involved
   to sync up. Give it a full minute before you give up.

    In some cases a machine will even get as far as clearing the
   graphics mode screen and starting up the music track, but will
   lose the game at that point.

        Q: What does "game mode indeterminate" mean?
        A: The author has only seen this error message once, on a
   VERY long distance connection attempt. The two ends found each
   other quickly, went through the entire startup sequence, only to
   have DOOM dump out immediately to DOS with the above error
   message. Upgrading both ends of the connection to DOOM 1.666
   resulted in a successful connection.


         Pointers and Tips for More Killing Enjoyment

        We'd like to leave you with a few experiences and opinions
   about long distance deathmatches.
   
        First, try not to use the "pause" key.  Do NOT use the pause
   key just so you can type a message.  DO use the pause key if you
   have to answer the phone. Do NOT release the pause after someone
   else pauses.  It's hard to yell at someone over an IP connection. 
   It really annoying to play against people who like to pause just
   when they're about to be shot.  Argh!

        Second, DO type messages.  A pause at the beginning of the
   game is OK just to see if the other player is there.  If you
   notice a sudden increase in game speed, the other player may have
   aborted.  You might end up playing by yourself if you are not
   watching... If you can monitor network traffic (I have a repeater
   nearby that gets very busy when I play), notice the difference
   between the amount of traffic when connected and disconnected.

        Third, Be patient.  It sometimes takes 30-60 seconds for the
   connection to complete.  The first phase, finding a node, should
   be immediate.  As mentioned above, if you cannot find a node,
   something is wrong.  The second phase, looking/sending network
   start info, may take 30 seconds.  The third phase, sometimes a
   blank screen just before the game loads, may take another 15-30
   seconds.  After finding a node, please don't abort until you have
   waiting a sufficient time for a connect. Also, if your connection
   doesn't work the first time, try again immediately! If it failed
   on your end, chances are it failed on the other end, also, and
   your partner will be back "Looking for a Node..." and wondering
   where you are.
   
        Forth, Internet games will self abort sometimes with errors. 
   Don't panic, just restart the tcpsetup command line (writing a
   batch file will save you from lots of typing and possible typos). 
   Sometimes one of the computers will lock up - just restart.  If
   you get tired of restarting (this doesn't happen much), just walk
   away! It's just a game!
   
        Last, Pray for a fast connection. This isn't always a
   problem, but when the connection is slow, the game sucks! There's
   nothing you can do about it. Sometimes the game will speed up and
   slow down throughout the match.  Such is the Internet.
   Re-connection will not help.  Every packet that is sent back and
   forth picks a new path and sometimes it's a fast path, and
   sometimes not.

                         iDOOM, IRC, and #doom

        If you have access to Internet DOOM, then you can probably
   access IRC. If you have an account on a UNIX machine, try typing
   irc at the command prompt - chances are good that a client has
   already been installed which you can access. If not, IRC clients
   for your PC can be obtained via anonymous ftp from cs-ftp.bu.edu. 
   One especially nice one (if you run Windows) is WSIRC. To meet
   other players, join either the #tcpdoom of #iDOOM channel.  You
   will be able to find iDOOM games here at almost any time of the
   day or night. When you join, say "Hi" to everyone, then ask is
   anyone is up for iDOOM DEATHMATCH. If you don't get any responses
   right away, just hang out for a while and watch. Sooner or later
   someone will sign on who would also like to play. Don't make the
   mistake of re-posting your request every couple of minutes, or
   bombarding everyone who joins the channel with your request -
   such behavior will quickly annoy other users and may result in
   your being flamed or even kicked off the channel. Don't worry
   about missing any opportunities - other players who want a game
   will most definitely follow the same procedure you did - they'll
   ask the for a game shortly after joining the channel. When you
   see the invitation, that is your cue to respond. You can then
   send private /MSGs to set up the game, or jump to a new channel
   to negotiate your game parameters. Also, if you're in a computer
   lab (and thus have two machines right next to each other) you can
   stay logged on to irc with one machine while you play iDOOM with
   the other. This can come in VERY handy in case of connection
   problems!

                               A Quick Note about FRAGSERVERS
   
        FRAGSERVERS are a recent development. They facilitate iDOOM
   connections between multiple players quickly and easily and with
   a minimum of command line typing. To use the frag servers, you'll
   need the file TCPSRV01.ZIP from one of the infant2 mirrors in the
   /pub/doom/multi_doom/net directory. A couple of the more popular
   fragservers can be found at ararat.cs.ucdavis.edu and
   patriot.et.buy.edu. Both of these support 2, 3 and 4 player games
   on ports 1666, 1667, and 1668 respectively.
   
        You call also compete in the ongoing TCP Doom Tourney.
   Contact Jay Cotton at jay@calc.vet.uga.edu for information on
   joining the tourney.  You can also get help running iDOOM and
   meet the authors of many of the best wads and utilities on #doom.
   Be warned! The IRC and Internet DOOM can be VERY addictive. Don't
   lose your "real" life just to play a game!
