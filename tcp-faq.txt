                         Introduction

   id Software's DOOM is truly the Killer App of the MS-DOS world.
   DOOM's popularity is so immense, it has been estimated that DOOM
   is installed on more PCs than OS/2 and Windows NT combined, and
   DOOM's creators commute to work in Ferarris. Interest in the game
   has been so great that it has been hacked, reverse-engineered,
   dissected, and enhanced more than any other game in PC history.
   And now, as more and more people become hooked into the Internet,
   DOOM is rapidly becoming the Killer App of the Internet, as well.
   
        Internet DOOM play is currently at the "clever hack" stage.
   DOOM, as released by iD, supports only IPX network play and
   serial play between two machines. As a result, the DOOM
   documentation doesn't include any information about DOOMing
   across the Internet. Of course, this also means that DOOMers
   can't call id for help. The result of all this is many curious
   people asking the same question: How do I play DOOM over the
   Internet? Enter this document. In the pages that follow, we will
   attempt to answer the most frequently asked questions about
   Internet DOOM, including what you need, how to set it up, and how
   to find new fragbait - er, I mean, opponents.
   
        DOOM across the Internet is made possible by a neat little
   freeware program called iDOOM. iDOOM uses the UDP protocol (part
   of the TCP/IP protocol suite) to send DOOM game information
   between multiple machines on the Internet. It is based on the
   WATTCP TCP/IP kernel written by Eric Engelke of the University of
   Waterloo. By some strange coincidence, the authors of this
   document are also the creators of iDOOM, and we have used the
   program to play Internet DOOM sessions with opponents from as far
   away as Estonia. In writing this FAQ, we hope that sharing some
   of our experience will make it easier for you to get connected in
   your own Internet DOOM sessions. NOTE: Throughout this document,
   we will refer specifically to games of DOOM played over the
   Internet via a DIRECT CONNECTION, i.e. no modems are involved
   anywhere in the link. Note that IHHD, SLIP and PPP connections
   all involve modems at some point. Although other methods of
   connecting two DOOM machines together across the Internet exist,
   this document will focus on direct net connections using the
   iDOOM network driver program.
   
   
   
                        Getting Prepared
   
        Q1: I want to play DOOM over the Internet using iDOOM. What
   hardware do I need?
   
        To successfully play DOOM across the Internet, you will need
   the following hardware:
   
        * A machine capable of playing DOOM (D'OHH!) 
   
        * A network interface card (NIC). And not just any old NIC,
        mind you - your NIC must be supported by a packet driver if
        you wish to use it to play Internet DOOM. Usually this means
        that your NIC must be an ethernet card, although iDOOM has
        been successfully played over token ring. This document
        assumes that your PC is already equipped with a suitable
        NIC, although it may currently be in use for some other
        non-TCP/IP function (such as a node on a Novell network).
   
        * A direct connection to the Internet. If there is a modem
        somewhere in the link between your PC and your opponent's
        PC, this FAQ is not for you. Although it is possible to play
        Internet DOOM over a modem link (either by dialing up to a
        UNIX machine and using IHHD or via SLIP/PPP), such
        connection methods are beyond the scope of this document.  
              
   
        Q2: OK, I've got all the hardware. What software do I need? 
                  
        In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is
   also required to round out your the package. Before you can play,
   you'll need to pick up the following:
   
        * DOOM 1.2 or higher (1.7 is STRONGLY recommended, since
        this version seems to have solved some problems related to
        network games). DOOM versions 1.1 and below are incapable of
        using iDOOM.
   
        * A packet driver written specifically for your ethernet
        card. The Packet Driver is what lets iDOOM (and therefore
        DOOM) "talk" to your NIC.
   
        * iDOOM.EXE, the Internet driver for DOOM.  
        
        * The WATTCP Applications. These are not absolutely
        necessary, but can definitely be useful for debugging and
        testing your setup. 
   
        Q3: Hold on - I don't have some of this software! Where can
   I get it?
   
        * To obtain iDOOM: Log on to ftp.vet.uga.edu via anonymous
        ftp. Change to directory /pub/doom. Download the file
        IDOOM11.ZIP. Version 1.1 is the latest version of iDOOM as
        of this writing. 
   
        * Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet
        drivers on a utilities diskette packaged with the card. If
        your card does not come with a packet driver, there is an
        excellent collection of freely available packet drivers
        called the Crynwr (nee Clarkson) Packet Driver collection.
        You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu.
        Change to the /pub/msdos/pktdrvr subdirectory and download
        PKTD11.ZIP and PKTD11C.ZIP. The files PKTD11A.ZIP and
        PKTD11B.ZIP contain source code and example programs for the
        packet drivers - you won't need these in order to play
        iDOOM.
   
        * To obtain the WATTCP applications, ftp to
        dorm.rutgers.edu, change to the /pub/msdos/wattcp/
        subdirectory, and download file APPS.ZIP.
                  
        Q4: OK, I've got everything, now what do I do to set it up? 
   
        Setting your computer up for TCP/IP access is very
   straightforward. As an illustration, I'll be taking you through
   the steps necessary to set up a PC with an SMC ethernet card and
   the IP address 128.192.23.5. You'll of course need to substitute
   your own specific information in place of the examples given
   here. All set? OK, let's get started.
   
        Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible. This
   includes such things as memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386, QEMM,
   etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI). DOOM doesn't need
   the former, and the latter will probably conflict with the packet
   driver. We recommend that you prepare a boot floppy with a
   CONFIG.SYS containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT
   containing only the line "prompt=$p$g".
   
        Step 1: Set up the packet driver. Determine your ethernet
   card's IRQ setting, it's base I/O port setting, and it's memory
   address setting (if any). You should be able to determine this by
   looking at the card itself and consulting the user manual. You'll
   need some if not all of this information, depending upon which
   packet driver you use and/or type of hardware you have (for
   example, some IBM computers with the MicroChannel bus can
   determine the settings on the card automatically without you
   having to supply them on the packet driver command line). Unzip
   the appropriate driver from Crynwr Packet Driver collection
   archive. In our example case, the packet driver is called
   SMC_WD.COM. By looking at the jumpers on the card and consulting
   the manual, I determined that the card has been set to IRQ 7,
   Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory address is at
   segment d800h. For this example, I have chosen to use interrupt
   60h for the packet driver. Packet drivers typically operate on an
   interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing
   else in my sample system happens to be using the first available
   interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that. Thus, to load my packet
   driver, I use the command line
   
   
        SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800
   
   where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
   on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is
   the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
   notation). Don't worry if you don't understand what all this
   stuff means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet
   driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a
   Novell network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
   parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG,
   usually located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT
   subdirectories (along with all the other drivers needed by
   Novell). 
   
        At the very minimum, the packet driver should give a sign on
   message and report the ethernet address of your NIC when you load
   it. Chances are that if your NIC has been functioning properly
   for other tasks (e.g. as a node on a Novell network) then you'll
   have no problems here. If not, or if there are any error or
   warning messages, something is wrong. One possibility is that one
   of the settings on your NIC is in conflict with those of another
   expansion card in your system. No two cards can have the same
   IRQ, I/O port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory
   areas of two cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll need to
   find and correct the problem before continuing.
   
        Step 2: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file. Your WATTCP.CFG file
   contains important parameters used by the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel.
   These values MUST be entered correctly if you wish to make a
   connection with another DOOM PC. In preparation for this, you'll
   need several bits of information. Contact the network
   administrator for your site and find out the IP address for your
   machine, the IP address for your gateway or router, the IP
   address of at least one Domain Name Server local to your site,
   and your netmask value. The three IP addresses will each consist
   of four groups of digits separated by periods. In our example,
   the machine's IP address is 128.192.23.5, the gateway is
   128.192.23.1, the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the nameserver
   address is 128.192.44.67. NOTE: it is important to use the
   numeric IP addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you
   have other Internet programs currently installed on your machine,
   such as a Gopher client or the Trumpet newsreader, you can
   probably find the information you need in the configuration files
   used for those programs. If the application is based on the
   Waterloo TCP package, it will have it's own WATTCP.CFG, in which
   case you can simply copy it over to your DOOM directory. When you
   have collected all this information, unzip the iDOOM distribution
   archive (e.g. IDOOM11.ZIP) into your DOOM (or DOOM2) directory.
   Use your favorite ASCII text editor to edit the file called
   WATTCP.CFG. Edit or add the following lines in WATTCP.CFG:
   
   my_ip=
   gateway=
   nameserver=
   netmask=
   
        On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file looks like this: 
        
   my_ip=128.192.23.5
   gateway=128.192.23.1
   netmask=255.255.255.0
   nameserver=128.192.44.67
   
        Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.
   
   
        If you know your machine's IP address, but you can't
   determine the other values, you can often get away with some
   educated guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet
   usually has an IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our
   example. Thus, if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting
   your gateway's IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet
   mask, a common value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. In some
   cases, the gateway value can be something like xxx.yyy.1.1 with a
   corresponding netmask value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work,
   it can't hurt to try the other. Finally, if you don't know your
   nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by without it for
   the purposes of DOOM playing. Since you'll be specifying IP
   addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a nameserver
   lookup won't be necessary to resolve their addresses. 
   
        Step 3: Test your TCP/IP setup. Load your packet driver with
   the appropriate interrupt, IRQ, I/O and memory addresses. Next,
   unzip the TCPINFO and PING programs from the WATTCP apps archive
   into your DOOM directory. At the DOS prompt, type:
   
             TCPINFO    
   
   and press the <Enter> key. If your WATTCP.CFG values are set up
   correctly, and if your packet driver and net connection are
   functional, you'll see a couple of screens of information about
   your system, including your ethernet address and the parameters
   you specified in the WATTCP.CFG file. 
   
        If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING
   program to attempt to establish contact with your subnet gateway.
   At the DOS prompt, type
   
        PING <yourgateway's.numeric.ip.address>
   
   and press the <Enter> key. After a brief delay, you should see a
   message telling you that the host is responding, as well as the
   round trip time for PING's test packets. If you see the "Timeout"
   error message, then something is wrong with your setup; if your
   PC is unable to reach your gateway, it will be unable to reach
   the rest of the Internet as well, since all network packets which
   are sent to nodes outside of your local area network must pass
   through your gateway. For our sample system, we would type:
   
             ping 128.192.23.1
   
   If your gateway PING was successful, try PINGing your Domain Name
   Server (at the IP address you specified in WATTCP.CFG) as well as
   some well-known site on the internet (e.g. infant2, which is at
   IP address 129.79.234.115). These will test your machine's
   ability to connect with other machines outside of your subnet as
   well as those outside of your site. All of these PINGs should
   result in a "host responding" message with a response time. If
   any of these attempts fails, recheck your entries in WATTCP.CFG
   and/or get some help from your network administrator. Examples
   for our test system:
   
        ping 128.192.44.67
   
   and

        ping 129.79.234.115

   
             Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play! 
        First, go find up to three of your most patient frag
   buddies. Since this is your first attempt at Internet DOOM, it's
   best to try and find someone on your local network who's willing
   to put in a little frag time with you. Connections on your local
   net will be faster and less problematic, whereas if you attempt a
   long distance connection your first time out, you'll have a hard
   time discerning problems caused by distance from problems caused
   by an incorrect configuration.
   
        Decide amongst yourselves which machine will be the "server"
   (the remaining machines in the game will all be "clients"). The
   server machine (and there can only be ONE server per game) acts
   as the coordinator for that session. The player operating the
   server is in some sense "the boss" - she can decide when to start
   the game, which parameters (e.g. -altdeath, -nomonsters, -warp, -
   skill, etc.) will be used, whether to kick a player out, and so
   on.
   
        The server starts iDOOM as follows:
   
   iDOOM -server [other game parameters]
   
        Once the server has started iDOOM running, the clients (all
   remaining players) can then connect to the server. Each client
   invokes iDOOM using the command line:
   
   iDOOM -client <server_address>
   
        As an example, consider several computers which are part of
   a local area network in a computer lab. In this lab there are
   identical machines sitting side by side, with sequential IP
   addresses, i.e. 128.192.23.4, 128.192.23.5, and 128.192.23.6.
   After stepping through the basic configuration process outlined
   above on all test machines, my frag buddies and I are ready to
   begin. First, we all agree to play our favorite DEATHMATCH level,
   DOOM I episode 1 map 5. We also agree to play in -altdeath mode,
   with -skill 5 and -nomonsters. On my machine, which we decided
   will be the server, I type:
   
   iDOOM -server -warp 1 5 -altdeath -skill 5 -nomonsters
   
        The iDOOM screen comes up, and a message is displayed
   informing me that iDOOM is entering server mode. This screen is
   divided into several sections: the credits, the output window,
   the status bar, and the input line. At the top of the screen is
   the name of the program, its version number, and the copyright
   notice. The large area beginning with the second screen line and
   continuing to the 22nd screen line is the output window. Here is
   where iDOOM will display all status messages as well as the chat
   text entered by the other players. Below the output window is the
   status bar, where the current game settings are displayed. Below
   the status bar is the input line where all the text I type on my
   keyboard will appear. Finally, the bottom line of the screen
   lists significant contributors to iDOOM.
   
        Once my iDOOM server is up and running, all the other
   players can connect to it. The other guys type:
   
   iDOOM -client 128.192.23.5
   
        Each client's screen layout is identical to that of my
   server. iDOOM displays a message confirming that it is entering
   client mode and connecting to the server. As each client's
   connection is established, the arrival of each player is
   announced by the server. 
   
        During this phase of the game setup, all players who have
   connected thus far can type messages to each other using iDOOM's
   built-in chat facility. To send a message to the other players in
   the game, I simply type my message on the keyboard. My keystrokes
   appear in the input line at the bottom of the screen, and when I
   press <ENTER>, the text will be echoed to the screens of all
   players (along with an indication of who sent the message). The
   identical procedure can be used to send messages from each of the
   client machines. The server itself will also send messages.
   Messages from the server will begin with three asterisks ("***"). 
   
        When a client connects to the iDOOM server, the client
   receives a message containing the game parameters which will be
   used during that session. These game settings will be displayed
   on the status bar. The settings are abbreviated to ensure that
   they will all fit within the available space. These game settings
   may be changed interactively at the server console.
   
        My friend sees that I have selected E1M5 as the default
   episode and map for our game. He reminds me that we've been
   playing that one a lot lately, and suggests we change to E2M2
   since we haven't played that one in a while. I agree, and issue
   the commands /episode 2 and /map 2 to change the level. Our
   status lines are immediately updated to reflect these changes.
   
        Once I have determined (via the chat facility) that everyone
   is ready to begin the game, I press the F10 key. The iDOOM server
   signals the clients that the game is beginning, the chat facility
   is shut down, and iDOOM sets up the connections which will be
   used for the actual game. Once these network links are
   established between all the machines, the message "Prepare to
   meet your DOOM!" is displayed, followed by the usual DOOM startup
   information. Shortly thereafter, the screen melts away and there
   we are, in E1M5, pistols at the ready! 
   
        Give your buddies a good thrashing - you've earned it! Now,
   after you've gotten DOOM working on your own subnet, you're ready
   for the final step. Find a partner who is also capable of playing
   Internet DOOM. Watch the posts in alt.games.doom, or tune into
   the #doom, #tcpdoom or #iDOOM channels on irc. You and he will
   negotiate game parameters, such as which map to play, which skill
   level, and so on. You'll also decide on who will be the server
   and who will be the clients (experienced DEATHMATCHers will often
   try very hard to avoid being the server, since that player's
   uniform is colored day-glo green and is easier to spot in a
   DEATHMATCH). Now simply add the parameters you've agreed on to
   the iDOOM server command line you used before. A typical          
   command line will look something like
   
             iDOOM -server -skill 5 -nomonsters -deathmatch 
   
   
                   Oh Oh - It's Not Working!
   
             OK, so you've done everything, just like I've shown
   you, but you're still having problems. The following are some
   suggestions to try in case of trouble.
   
        Q: When I try to connect to the iDOOM server it returns to
   DOS saying "Server is not responding" or "Remote reset
   connection."
   
        A: This means that the player on the server machine hasn't
   yet  started the iDOOM server. The server must be started before
   the clients try to connect to it. Try again in a few seconds.
   
   
        Q: I keep seeing an "ICMP: port unreachable" message on my
   screen.
   
        A: This message is generated by the other machine when the
   port being requested by the sender is unavailable on the          
   destination machine. I've seen this happen in some cases when I
   started iDOOM before the other player did. Once the other iDOOM
   was running, the ICMP: messages went away, and the game linked up
   normally. If you see this message, you might also want to try
   using a different port (see the iDOOM documentation on the -port
   command line parameter). 
   
        Q: The music starts up fine, but all I see is a BSOD (Black
   Screen of Death).
        Q: My machine displays "sending network start info" or
   "listening for network start info" and then locks up. 
   
        A: This problem can have several causes. Perhaps the server
   specified a DOOM II game, but one of the players didn't have DOOM
   II. Perhaps one of the other players' machines is slower than the
   others, or has a fragmented disk and takes a longer time to load
   DOOM at startup. Or perhaps some packets were lost - iDOOM uses
   UDP (user Datagram Protocol) packets to exchange game information
   between all machines in the game. UDP packets are not guaranteed
   to reach their destination, and there is no mechanism for the
   sender to even be informed that what it sent never made to the
   destination machine. iDOOM is designed to compensate for these
   lost packets to the extent possible, and occasionally this
   detection and correction takes a few extra seconds. You should
   always wait for at least 30 - 45 seconds for the other DOOM
   engines to sync up before you abort the setup. 
   
   
         Pointers and Tips for More Fragging Enjoyment 
   
        We'd like to leave you with a few experiences and opinions
   about Internet deathmatches.
   
        First, try not to use the "pause" key. Do NOT use the pause
   key just so you can type a message. DO use the pause key if you
   have to answer the phone; either find a hiding place to hole up,
   or if you are fragged, just stay dead (don't hiot the spacebar)
   until your call is completed. It's inconsiderate to make everyone
   else wait on you. Do NOT release the pause after someone else
   pauses.  It's hard to yell at someone over an IP connection. It's
   really annoying to play against people who like to pause just
   when they're about to be shot.  Argh!
   
        Second, DO type messages. A pause at the beginning of the
   game is OK just to see if the other player is there.  If you
   notice a sudden increase in game speed, another player may have
   aborted or crashed. You might end up playing by yourself if you
   are not alert... If you can monitor network traffic (I have a
   repeater nearby that gets very busy when I play), notice the
   difference between the amount of traffic when connected and
   disconnected. 
   
        Third, Be patient. It sometimes takes 30-60 seconds for the
   connection to complete. The first phase, finding a node, should
   be immediate. As mentioned above, if you cannot find a node,
   something is wrong. The second phase, looking/sending network
   start info, may take 30 seconds, longer if one of the players has
   a slow or fragmented hard disk (this is the phase where DOOM
   loads the info it needs to play from the WAD file(s)).  The third
   phase, sometimes a blank screen just before the game loads, may
   take another 15-30 seconds.  After finding a node, please don't
   abort until you have waiting a sufficient time for a connect.
   Also, if your connection doesn't work the first time, try again
   immediately! If it failed on your end, chances are it failed on
   the other end, also, and your partner will be back in iDOOM
   trying to connect and wondering where you are.
   
        Forth, Internet games will self abort sometimes with errors.
   Don't panic, just restart iDOOM. Sometimes one of the computers
   will lock up - again, just restart. If you get tired of
   restarting (this doesn't happen much), just walk away! It's just
   a game!
   
        Last, hope for a fast connection. This isn't always a
   problem, but when the connection is slow, the game sucks! There's
   nothing you can do about it. Sometimes the game will speed up and
   slow down throughout the match.  Such is the Internet.
   Re-connection will not help. Every packet that is sent back and
   forth picks a new path; sometimes it's a fast path, and sometimes
   not.
   
   
   Finding Other iDOOM Players
   
        There are many ways to find opponents for your TCP/IP
   Internet DOOM games. One is to contact your friends who play DOOM
   and arrange a time for a game. However, everyone will
   occasionally find times when nobody they know is available to
   play. Fortunately, there are some virtual equivalents to walking
   down to the basketball court and joining a pickup game. 
   
   
                                       IRC
   
        If your setup is capable of Internet DOOM, then you can
   probably also use IRC, the Internet Relay Chat. If you have an
   account on a UNIX machine, try typing irc at the command prompt -
   chances are good that a client has already been installed which
   you can access. If not, IRC clients for your PC can be obtained
   via anonymous ftp from cs-ftp.bu.edu. One especially nice one (if
   you run Windows) is WSIRC. To meet other players, join either the
   #tcpdoom of #iDOOM channel - the sole purpose of these channels
   if for Internet DOOM players to meet other players and arrange
   games. The #doom channel is for more general discussions of DOOM.
   Although some people also arrange games there, #tcpdoom is the
   preferred meeting place. You will be able to find iDOOM games
   here at almost any time of the day or night. 
   
        When you /join the channel, be friendly. Say "Hi" to
   everyone, then ask is anyone is up for iDOOM DEATHMATCH. If you
   don't get any responses right away, just hang out for a while and
   watch, or engage in some random chit-chat. The people currently
   on the channel might be already be playing a game (/away), and
   thus cannot respond to your invitation immediately. It's quite
   common for players who have two machines to use one as an irc
   terminal and the other for playing DOOM. Thus, they may not be
   looking at their irc screen when you first sign on. Sooner or
   later, though, someone will sign on (or return) who would also
   like to play. Don't make the mistake of re-posting every couple
   of minutes, or bombarding everyone who joins the channel with
   your request - such behavior will quickly annoy other users and
   may result in your being flamed or even kicked off the channel.
   Don't worry about missing any opportunities - other players who
   want a game will most definitely follow the same procedure you
   did - they'll ask the for a game shortly after joining the
   channel. When you see the invitation, that is your cue to
   respond. You can then negotiate your game parameters. Also, if
   you're in a computer lab (and thus have two machines right next
   to each other) you can stay logged on to irc with one machine
   while you play iDOOM with the other, as mentioned above. This can
   come in VERY handy in case of connection problems!
   
   
                           Frag Servers/Frag Trackers
   
        Frag Servers are a recent development. They facilitate iDOOM
   connections between multiple players quickly and easily and with
   a minimum of command line typing. Current versions of the Frag
   Servers are very similar to the server built into iDOOM. NOTE: An
   iDOOM client can NOT connect to a Frag Server. Frag Servers have
   their own client program which then loads iDOOM as the network
   driver. 
   
        As of this writing, the latest version of the frag
   client/server package is TCPSRV12.ZIP, available from one of the
   infant2 mirrors in the /pub/doom/multi_doom/net directory. A
   couple of the more popular fragservers can be found at
   ararat.cs.ucdavis.edu and patriot.et.buy.edu. Both of these
   support 2, 3 and 4 player games on ports 1666, 1667, and 1668
   respectively.
   
        Future versions of the Frag Servers (which will be known as
   Frag Trackers) will serve as online meeting places where DOOM
   players can log on, see a list of games which are awaiting
   players, and either join an existing game or register a new game.
   Waiting players will be able to send chat messages to each other,
   negotiate and set game parameters, check connection quality, etc.
   Although this exciting capability does not exist in the current
   Frag Servers, it will be available sometime in the near future,
   and will revolutionize the way Internet DOOM is played.

                        A Final Thought
   
        The TCP/IP Internet DOOM and the IRC can be VERY addictive.
   Have fun, but don't lose your "real" life just to play a game!
