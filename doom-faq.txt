CHAPTER *1*: Introduction
-------------------------

*1-1*: A word from Hank Leukart
===============================
        It has been more than two months since the last release of the FAQ,
and there is a lot of good reasons.  I promised to have a FAQ out at around
the same time that DOOM v1.2 was released, but DOOM v1.2 was delayed for
about a month and a half.  I had a hard drive crash, and all of the work I
had previously done on v5.5 of the FAQ was gone.  My E-mail box keeps
overflowing, and at the rate the information is coming in, there would not
be ANY way for me to release the FAQ if I had not drawn the line somewhere.
Anyway, here it is, the "Official" DOOM FAQ v5.5.
        DOOM iNsAnItY was removed (sorry) due to size complaints, but the
last edition of DOOM iNsAnItY has been released with this FAQ.  Look for it
in the file "dinsan55.txt" on the Internet or "dinsan55.zip" on BBSs.  DOOM
v1.2 has been released, which has caused one huge problem: modem support.
After weeding through hundreds of messages, and with the help of a few
others, a list of modem strings that work with DOOM is included in this
FAQ.  I hope one of them works for you!  "Keep on DOOMing!"

[1-2]: About the "Official" DOOM FAQ
====================================
        Welcome to the post-release v5.5 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  What
does that mean?  Post-release is after the game is released, version 5.5 is a
standard revision written after 5.0, "Official" means absolutely nothing,
DOOM is the name of the game, and FAQs are [F]requently [A]sked [Q]uestions.
        Here's how revision classification works.  If a new version of
the FAQ only has a small amount of information changed or added, the version
number is increased by 0.1.  This is called a "minor revision."  If a new
version of the FAQ has a substantial amount of new information changed or
added, the version number is increased by 0.5.  This is called a "standard
revision." If a new version of the FAQ has a huge amount of added or changed
information, major parts of the FAQ are rearranged, or major parts of the FAQ
are rewritten, then the version number is increased by 1.0.  This is called a
"major revision."  Keep in mind this rule does not apply to v5.0 since I
wanted to make a significant change in version number, without starting at
v1.0 again.
        You may be wondering why chapter numbers are enclosed in either
[]'s, ()'s, or **'s.  The definition of these is as follows:

        []: Chapters enclosed in brackets mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated in this or the
            previous FAQ.
        (): Chapters enclosed in parenthesis mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated since the previous
            FAQ.
        **: Chapters enclosed in asterisks means that the information
            contained in the chapter is new or has been updated for the
            current version of the FAQ you are reading.

*1-3*: Getting the "Official" DOOM FAQ
======================================
        I am sorry to announce that the DOOM Mailing List has been
cancelled, due to numerous problems.  Anyone who has had a subscription to
the list in the past will no longer receive updates, and no new
subscriptions are NOT permitted.
        However, a NEW mailing list has been created, but is not
maintained by myself.  It is run by an automatic listserver.  To subscribe,
send mail to "listserv@cedar.univie.ac.at" with "sub DOOML <your address>"
IN THE BODY of the message.  DO NOT put a subject on this message.  To post
to the mailing list, send mail to "DOOML@cedar.univie.ac.at".  If you are
having trouble using this, send mail to "listserv@cedar.univie.ac.at" with
the word "HELP" IN THE BODY of the message.  Again, put not subject on the
message.  If you are having problems with the server, mail
"savage@cedar.univie.ac.at" with your problem.
        The "Official" DOOM FAQ can still be requested from me, however.  My
Internet E-mail address is "ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu."  Please make the
subject of your E-mail "DOOM FAQ Request."

        The "Official" DOOM FAQ is posted every two weeks (or earlier
if a new version is released) on the following Usenet groups.

        (1) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action
        (2) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.announce
        (3) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc

        The "Subject:" line of the post will be "'Official' DOOM FAQ v??.??"
where "??.??" is the version number of the FAQ.

        New releases of the "Official" DOOM FAQ are uploaded to the
following Internet FTP sites.

        (1) ftp.uwp.edu          IN DIR  /pub/incoming/id
                                 IN DIR  /pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew/doom
        (2) wuarchive.wustl.edu  IN DIR  /pub/msdos_uploads/games/doomstuff

        The file name of the upload will be "doom??.faq" where "??" is the
version number of the FAQ.

        New releases of the "Official" DOOM FAQ are uploaded to Software
Creations BBS (and other BBSs) under the file name "dmfaq??.zip" where "??"
is the version number of the FAQ.

Software Creations BBS:

[1-6]: Accurate Information
===========================
        An attempt has been made to make the information in this FAQ as
accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the game
was recently released, and updates, add-ons, and new information are being
worked on each second, it's hard to keep up.  I had to stop myself from
adding to the FAQ, because if I didn't it would have never been released!
The original press release dated from January 1993 listed a few things that
didn't go in the final game.  Some of those things were impossible to do
after rewriting the 3-D engine 4 times over (for speed and size); other
things just made no sense with the rest of the design.  Trust id Software.
They know what they are doing.  DOOM is one great game!

=====================================
=SECTION ONE= PRELIMINARY INFORMATION
=====================================

--------------------------
CHAPTER [2]: What is DOOM?
--------------------------

        DOOM is a three dimensional, virtual reality type action game
created by id Software.  In some ways, it is similar to Wolfenstein 3-D
(id Software, Apogee).
        In DOOM, you're a space marine, one of Earth's toughest, hardened in
combat and trained for action.  Three years ago you assaulted a superior
officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians.  He and his body
cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home
of the Union Aerospace Corporation.
        The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste
facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.  With no action for
fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' dust and watchin'
restricted flicks in the rec room.
        For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest supplier, has
used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various
secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel.
So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos,
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other.
Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable.
Military "volunteers" entering them have either disappeared or been
stricken with a strange form of insanity--babbling vulgarities,
bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely
death of full-body explosion.  Matching heads with torsos to send home
to the folks became a full-time job.  Latest military reports state
that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is
under control.
        A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos.  "We
require immediate military support.  Something fraggin' evil is coming
out of the gateways!  Computer systems have gone berserk!" The rest
was incoherent.  Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky.
Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been
unsuccessful.
        You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles
were sent up pronto to Phobos.  You were ordered to secure the perimeter of
the base while the rest of the team went inside.  For several hours, your
radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders,
screams, bones cracking, then finally silence.  Seems your buddies are dead.
        Things aren't looking too good.  You'll never navigate off the
planet on your own.  Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by
the assault team leaving you only with a pistol.  If only you could get your
hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on
your way out.  Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in
the forehead.  Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod.  Hopefully you
can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.  As you
walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls
echoing throughout the distant corridors.  They know you're here.  There's no
turning back now.

------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [3]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
------------------------------------------------------------

[3-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC.
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and scanned
textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an environment, makes the
world much more real, thus bringing the player more into the game experience.
Others have attempted this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate,
and seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big improvement
over Wolfenstein 3-D.  With their new advanced graphic development
techniques, allowing game art to be generated five times faster, id brings
new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[3-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's
walls are at many angles, and at many thickness.  Walls have see-through
areas, like windows.  This allows more natural construction of levels.  If
you can draw it on paper, you can see it in the game.

[3-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With
distance, your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This
makes areas seem huge and intensifies the experience.  This also creates some
amazing effects; sometimes the lights go out, and you'll have to look for a
light switch or light amplification visors.  Light sourcing allows lamps and
lights to illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe
lights to briefly reveal things near them.  These features will make the game
frighteningly real.

[3-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs,
poles, altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great
variety for rooms and halls.
        In DOOM, monsters can be shot on levels that are higher or lower than
you are.  All you have to do is aim laterally, and DOOM will do the rest!

[3-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it. Radioactive
ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment animation
and morphing.  Id Software removed information terminals, access stations,
and wall weapon damaging.  DOOM does include "crushing ceilings," however.

[3-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors), invincibility mode and a few other special effects.

[3-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  Shareware versions 1.0 and 1.1 do not
include modem and serial link support.  Later versions will support this.
You can see the other player in the environment, communicate with him or her,
and in certain situations you can switch to their view.  This feature, added
to the 3-D realism, makes DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its
release a landmark event in the software industry.  This is the first game to
really exploit the power of LANs and modems to their full potential.  In
1994, we fully expect to be the number one cause of decreased productivity
in businesses around the world.  See Chapter [8] for more information on
multi-playing.

[3-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the development end to
provide the smoothest control on the user end.  And the frame rate (the rate
at which the screen is updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to
room, turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky motion of
most 3-D games.  On a 386sx, the game runs well, and on a 486/33, the normal
mode frame rate is faster than movies or television.  This allows for the
most important and enjoyable aspect of gameplay: immersion.

[3-9]: New Monsters and Artificial Intelligence
===============================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed rooms.  When
you open a door, the guards get a chance to see you and opening the door
connects your sound area to the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will
be heard in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this kind of
action.  In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a bunch of
rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast your shotgun and the sound
could travel through a window or slime-river tunnel to another entirely
different area and piss-off some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking for
you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through slime, etc.  You'll
still be able to get the drop on them from behind, just like in Wolfenstein
3-D -- but you have to be sneakier about it.
        There is a huge amount of new enemies in DOOM.  Here is a list:

        FORMER HUMANS (dudes in filth-covered combat suits):  Just a few days
ago, you were probably swapping war stories with one of these guys.  Now it's
time to swap some lead upside their head.

        FORMER HUMAN SERGEANTS (dudes in black armor, also filthy):  Same as
above, but much meaner and tougher.  These walking shotguns provide you with
a few extra holes if you're not careful!

        IMPS (brown thorny hominids):  You thought an imp was cute little
dude in a red suit with a pitchfork.  Where did these brown bastards come
from?  They heave balls o' fire down your throat and take several bullets to
die.  It's time to find a weapon better than that pistol if you're going to
face more than one of these S.O.B.s.

        DEMONS (pink horrors, vaguely humanoid):  Sorta like a shaved
gorilla, except with horns, a big head, lots of teeth, and harder to kill.
Don't get too close or they'll rip your fraggin' head off.

        SPECTRES (vague, half-formed shapes):  Great.  Just what you needed.
An invisible (nearly) monster.

      * LOST SOULS (flying skulls):  Dumb.  Tough.  Flies.  On fire.  'Nuff
said. :)

      * CACODEMONS (gigantic floating one-eyes heads):  They float in the
air, belch ball-lightning, and boast one Hell of a big mouth.  You're toast
if you get too close to these monstrosities.

        BARONS OF HELL (you'll know `em when you see `em):  Tough as a dump
truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since
Tyrannosaurus Rex.

*:  Not found in the shareware version

[3-10]: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that are in DOOM.  Don't try using these at
home. :)

        (1) Fist
        (2) Chain Saw
        (3) Pistol
        (4) Shotgun
        (5) Chain Gun
        (6) Rocket Launcher
        (7) Plasma Rifle *
        (8) BFG9000 *

* = Denotes a weapon not implemented in the shareware version.

*3-10-1*: What does BFG9000 stand for?
--------------------------------------
        One can only guess. :)

------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]: Who created DOOM?
------------------------------

        DOOM was created by id Software, and is also published by
id Software.
        Id Software is made up of the following dedicated people:

        - John Romero     Coder         -
        - John Carmack    Coder         -
        - Dave Taylor     Coder         -
        - Adrian Carmack  Artist        -
        - Kevin Cloud     Artist        -
        - Jay Wilbur      CEO           -
        - Sandy Peterson  Designer      -
        - Shawn Green     Tech Support  -
        - Robert Prince   Music         -

Note:  Apogee has NOTHING to do with DOOM.

[4-1]: How can I contact id Software?
=====================================
        Id Software can be contacted via the Internet.  If you would like to
ask any questions about DOOM (that are not answered in here), send E-mail to

The number is (800)-ID-GAMES.  This number is for ordering games ONLY.  This
number is not for technical support or inquiries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
*5*: What are the differences between the different releases of DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*5-1*: What is the shareware release?
=====================================
        The shareware version of DOOM only includes one of the three missions
of DOOM.  Each mission contains eight levels and a secret level.  The
shareware version contains network support and modem support.  The shareware
version does NOT include the Plasma Rifle and the BFG9000 weapons.
On December 10th, 1993, v1.0 was released.  On December 16th, 1993, v1.1 was
released.  Finally, on February 17th, 1994, id released v1.2 of DOOM.  This
version fixes many bugs and adds new features, including modem support.

*5-2*: What is the mail-order release?
======================================
        The mail-order release of DOOM includes all three missions of DOOM.
Each mission contains eight levels and a secret level.  This version includes
all weapons.  All mail-order releases ordered before February 17th, 1994
are v1.1.  It is highly recommended that you upgrade to v1.2.

*5-3*: What makes the three versions different?
===============================================
        Three different version of DOOM have been released: v1.0, v1.1, and
v1.2.  Version 1.0 was the initial December 10th, 1993 release.  Version 1.1
was the first upgrade of DOOM, released on December 16th, 1993.  Although
this version fixed many bugs and compatibility problems, it introduced many
new ones.  The recently released v1.2 has these changes:

        o Serial-link and modem support for two player games
        o Removal of broadcast packets: directed network packets
        o Native PAS-16 support
        o A new NIGHTMARE difficulty mode in which:
                + All missile weapons fire twice as fast
                + Enemies move twice as fast
                + Enemies shoot 3 times as often
                + Monsters respawn eight seconds after death
        o DOOMDATA directory requirement removed
        o Mouse and joystick control in the menus
        o Better joystick calibration and fixed joystick control
        o Perfect gameplay under Windows
        o Cyberman(tm) support
        o Saved game bug corrected
        o Reoccuring Z_Malloc bug corrected
        o v1.2 will now return to lightning speed
        o Ten macros allowing you to easily send messages during multiplay
        o New command line parameters

        All mail-order releases ordered before February 17th, 1994 are
v1.1.  It is highly recommended that you upgrade to v1.2.  Anyone who
ordered v1.1 through id's (800)-ID-GAMES phone number will receive v1.2
free by mail.

[5-4]: What is the commercial release?
======================================
        The commercial version of DOOM will not be released until the middle
or late in 1994.  This version will contain more levels, more features, more
graphics, and more sounds.  Compare the commercial release of DOOM to
Wolfenstein 3-D's Spear of Destiny.  This release will NOT duplicate any
levels in either the shareware or mail-order releases.

*5-5*: What is the Jaguar release?
==================================
        Shawn Green of ID Software has been gracious enough to indulge a
nearly constant barrage of questions concerning the upcoming Jaguar version
of DOOM.  The Jaguar is a 32-bit game catridge system.

   *  Comlynx will be supported.  (2 Player: Jag to Jag communications)

   *  The game will be presented in 16 bit color (possibly - see next item).

   *  The final frame rate is expected to clock in at around 15-20 FPS.
      If ID reverts to 8-bit color (as in the PC version) 20 FPS is definite.
                The advantage is a little bit faster frame rate.
                The disadvantage is loss of color depth.

   *  The game will have digital music and (digitized?) sound effects.

   *  Game levels will be slightly different than the PC version.
      ID will take the best 20 levels from the PC version (all three
      episodes) and perform minor optimizations for speed. Included
      in the twenty levels will be a secret level.

   *  JagDoom will support automatic regeneration of monsters.  (After the
      enemy dies, he comes back again. And again. And again. Etc..)

   *  Save Games will come in the form of a password. All of the stats will be
      saved except for the location within a level.  Upon restoring game stats
      from a saved game, you will be placed at the beginning of the level.

   *  NO RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  Folks, don't
      bother the ID people about a release date.  They have a VARIETY
      of projects on the burner, and will get JagDoom out as soon as
      they are able.  Shawn says "A Summer release is feasible."

   *  NO PRICE HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  Cart memory is NOT cheap, and I'm
      sure this is a constraint that ID is struggling with as they work
      on the Jag version.

        Once again, I want to caution that this is PRELIMINARY information.
The DOOM engine is running on a Jag development system, but it has a
long way to go before it's ready to ship for manufacturing.  The info
presented here reflects how the game may LIKELY end up, but cart cost
is (sadly) a major concern when the game is being finalized.

----------------------------------
CHAPTER *6*: Where can I get DOOM?
----------------------------------

        Note: Unless you are an official id Software Beta-Tester, any Beta
version that you may have in your possession is a violation of U.S. federal
copyright laws.  Violation of these laws can result in fines of up to
$250,000 and jail terms of up to 5 years.  If you are in possession of a Beta
version, it is suggested that you delete your copy immediately.

*6-1*: How can I get the shareware release?
===========================================

*6-1-1*: What are the file names?
---------------------------------
        DOOM is released in two formats, a two file 1.44mb format, and a one
file 2mb format.  The 2mb format is released under the name
"doom1_2.zip".  The 1.44mb file names are "doom1_2a.zip" and "doom1_2b.zip."
        If you got DOOM before February 17th, 1994, it is highly recommended
that you upgrade to v1.2.  A patch under the file name "dm1_2spt.zip" is
available to upgrade the v1.1 shareware version to v1.2.  If your shareware
copy is v1.0, you must first upgrade to v1.1 with the "doom11pt.zip."  A
patch under the file name "dm1_2rpt.zip" is available to upgrade the v1.1
registered version to v1.2.  Additionally, a file named "altdoom1.zip" is
available for those people who's computers do not work with the DOOM DOS
Extenders.

        The mail-order release of DOOM is available directly from id
Software.  To order, call id Software's order number, (800)-ID-GAMES.
This number is for ORDERING ONLY, not for inquiries or technical support.
The mail-order version of DOOM costs $40.00.  If you live out of the United
States, you can still order DOOM by an out-of-country shareware
distributor.
        If you ordered DOOM before February 17th, 1994, it is highly
recommended that you upgrade to v1.2.  See Chapter [6-1-1] for more
information.  Anyone who ordered DOOM before February 17th, 1994, from the
(800)-ID-GAMES phone number will receive a copy of v1.2 by mail.  If you
live out of the United States, you can receive a copy of v1.2, free, from
your local shareware distributor.

[6-3]: How can I get the commercial release?
============================================
        The commercial release of DOOM will not be available until the middle
of or late 1994.  The price has not been set as yet.
        It will be available by mail-order directly from id Software, or at
your local software store. (assuming your software store is local) :)

*6-4*: How can I get the DOOM Specs for creating add-on utilities?
==================================================================
        The DOOM Specs have not been released yet, but will be released in
the near future.  These specs will basically be for disassembling the wad and
reassembling it.  You can turn pictures into patches, for example.  Id
Software will probably release the format for maps as well.  The actual map
editor is written in NextStep, so they won't be releasing that.
        However, the Unofficial DOOM Specs, written by Matt Fell and
released by myself are available.  See Chapter [14-7] for more information.

*6-5*: Where can I get the serial play source code?
===================================================
        The serial play source code is available on the FTP site
"ftp.uwp.edu" in the directory "/pub/msdos/games/id" under the filename
"sersrc.zip."

----------------------------------------
CHAPTER [7]: What is needed to run DOOM?
----------------------------------------

[7-1]: What is REQUIRED to run DOOM?
====================================
        DOOM requires a 386sx IBM compatible computer running MS-DOS v5.0 or
higher, VGA (320x200x256) graphics, and 4mb of RAM.  The shareware version of
DOOM needs about 4.8mb of hard drive space.  The mail-order version needs
about 12mb of hard drive space.
        DOOM will also be ported to the Atari Jaguar. No other ports are
planned at this time that id Software "can talk about."

[7-2]: What sound cards does DOOM support?
=========================================
        DOOM supports general MIDI, Adlib, Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro,
Sound Blaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas, Gravis UltraSound, WaveBlaster and
Pro Audio Spectrum 16.

[7-3]: What game controllers does DOOM support?
===============================================
        DOOM supports keyboard, mouse, joystick, and trackball (functioning
as a mouse).
        DOOM also supports the Gravis Gamepad and Logitech Cyberman.

----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER *8*: How can I use multiple players in DOOM?
----------------------------------------------------

        DOOM supports 2-4 players in a multi-player mode. DOOM is
playable over networks, modems and by serial link.

Note: For playing the registered DOOM over networks or by modem, EACH user
      MUST BUY his/her own individual copy of the game.

[8-1]: How does the multi-player gameplay work?
===============================================
        In DOOM, players are able to see each other, and watch each other
jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players are able to watch
others get hurt, die, and move throughout the labyrinth.  DOOM allows
players to play together, working as a team.  In this cooperative mode,
players can see each other on an "automap" and switch to each other's view.
DOOM also allows players to play against each other, in DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-1]: How does pausing, saving, and loading work?
====================================================
        In DOOM, some things change when playing with more than one player.
        When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the game KEEPS
RUNNING so that other players can continue with the action.  So, it is best
to find a safe place before adjusting screen size, sound, etc.
        A player may pause the game by pressing the PAUSE key, but any other
player can unpause the game by pressing the PAUSE key again.  Make sure it is
okay with your buddies before taking a breather.
        When you do a save game during network/modem play, it saves on every
player's system in the save game slot you select, writing over whatever was
there.  Before saving the game, players should agree on a safe slot to save
it in.
        You cannot load a saved game while playing a multi-player game. To
load a game, everyone must quit from the current game and restart the game
from a saved game.  To start a game from a saved game, you can either
select it from the SETUP program or identify it as a command line parameter.

[8-1-2]: What are the different uniform colors for?
---------------------------------------------------
        In network/modem games, each player's uniform is a different color.
The color of your character is the color behind your face on the status bar.
The colors are BROWN, INDIGO (black), GREEN, and RED.
        These are used to identify between players during game play, and
to chat with others using Chat Mode.

[8-1-3]: How does a player see what others are doing?
-----------------------------------------------------
        If you're playing in cooperative mode, press F12 to toggle through
the other players' viewpoint(s).  Press any other key to return to your
view.  You still retain your own status bar at the bottom, and if your view
reddens from pain it is YOU, not your partner, who has been hit.

*8-1-4*: How do players communicate using Chat Mode?
----------------------------------------------------
        In a multi-player game you can communicate with other players in the
Chat Mode.  To enter into Chat Mode and broadcast a message to all the other
players, press the letter "T".  A cursor will appear where your messaging is
normally placed.  To broadcast to a specific player, instead of pressing
"T", you'll need to press the first letter of the player's color: (B)rown,
(I)ndigo, (G)reen, and (R)ed.  For example, to send a message to the brown
character, you would press the letter "B".
        In DOOM v1.2, a macro capability has been added.  After defining
ten macros in SETUP.EXE, pressing the player color, and then
"ALT-<macro number>" will send a macro.

[8-1-5]: How do the weapons work?
---------------------------------
        When a player runs over a weapon, he picks it up, but the weapon
remains in the game for other players to take.  Shotguns dropped by former
human sergeants are removed from the game after being picked up or smashed.

[8-1-6]: What happens when a player dies?
-----------------------------------------
        If you die and restart in the level, previously taken items and
destroyed monsters don't reappear.  Even though you've died, other players
have survived.  However, this also means the level will eventually run dry of
monsters and ammunition.  You'll have to decide when the level is played out.

[8-1-7]: Can players exchange supplies?
---------------------------------------
        Players cannot exchange supplies.

[8-1-8]: Miscellaneous
----------------------
        In Cooperative mode, each player begins in the same area.  In
DeathMatch mode the players begin in completely different areas--if you want
to see your buddy you'll need to hunt him down.  Plus, each time you die,
you'll start in one of several random locations.
        Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, in DeathMatch
mode the players start at each location with the keys necessary for opening
any locked door in that area.
        In DeathMatch mode the ARMS section on the status bar is replaced
with "FRAG."  The FRAG section displays the number of times you've killed
your opponents.
        In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way it does in
single-player mode.  Each player is represented by a different color arrow.
In DeathMatch mode you won't receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on
the map.  Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around the
corner, and you won't know it until you face them.

[8-2]: What exactly is "DeathMatch" mode?
=========================================
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level is infested with enemies and power-ups.
Everyone must kill all the demons to ready the battlefield for the player
vs. player manhunt (my favorite gaming word).  In this mode, players can't
see the other players in the Automap, nor switch to their view.  Players are
not able to view other's health in the mode, because of the disadvantage this
can cause.

[8-3]: How does DOOM work with networks?
========================================
        DOOM supports the IPX (Novell Netware) protocol in the initial
shareware version.  Using this network support, DOOM can be played in a
workplace type environment.
        To start network mode:
        (1) Launch DOOM from the SETUP program, by going to the directory in
which you installed DOOM, typing SETUP, and pressing the ENTER key. Unlike
playing DOOM in single player mode, DOOM in multi-player mode must be run
either from the SETUP program or by using the command line parameters.
        (2) The SETUP program allows you to configure the information that
is necessary for the multi-player game. The SETUP is simple to use.
        (3) Start the game!

*8-3-1*: What are the command line parameters for DOOM?
-------------------------------------------------------
-LOADGAME allows you to start DOOM from a specified save game.  Instead of
using the saved game name, simply enter the number that corresponds to the
slot you saved the game to on the SAVE GAME screen
-loadgame <# of the game>

-DEATHMATCH starts DOOM as a DeathMatch game.  If you don't enter DEATHMATCH
as a command line parameter, DOOM will default to Cooperative mode.
-deathmatch

-SKILL sets the skill level (1-4) you wish to play.
-skill <# of skill level>

-EPISODE sets the episode (1-3) you wish to play.  The default episode is
Episode One, Knee-Deep in the Dead.
-episode <# of the episode>

-CONFIG allows you to use your configuration file from any directory you
choose.
-config <pathname> ex. -config f:\doom\data\myconfig.cfg

-NOMONSTERS allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running around!
This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters just get in the
way.
-nomonsters

-RESPAWN tells DOOM that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, you want all the
monsters to respawn 8 seconds after you kill them.  The NIGHTMARE skill
level already does this.  Not that using -respawn and -nomonsters at the
same time is a dumb thing to do.
-respawn

*8-3-2*: How can I use DOOM on Novell Netware Lite?
---------------------------------------------------
        Here is information on how to play DOOM on a Novell Netware Lite
network.

HOST/CLIENT (1) Load the LSL.  (LSL.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (2) Load your card driver.  (example: 3C5X9.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (3) Load your server.  (SERVER.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (4) Load your client.  (CLIENT.COM)
CLIENT      (5) Log into the network.
CLIENT      (6) Map the hosts to the hard drive.  (refer to NWL Manual)
HOST        (7) Run DOOM's SETUP.EXE, configure, and press F10.
CLIENT      (8) Change to mapped DOOM directory, and run DOOM, using the
                same options as used on the host.
            (9) PLAY DOOM!

*8-3-3*: How can I use DOOM on other types of networks?
-------------------------------------------------------
        It does not matter what type of network you use for DOOM, whether it
is Lantastic, Windows for Workgroups or other networks.  netDOOM uses the
cards at such a low level that it does not need the network services.  It
only needs the ODI/IPX drivers.
        This being the case, netDOOM works fine with any Ethernet or any
other cabling system. Naturally, you can not use any normal network services
at the same time.

        There are a number of ways of getting IPX working with a given
ethernet card.  One is to use a dedicated IPX driver for the card,
another is to run an IPX converter over some other standard such as
NDIS, ODI, or the packet driver standard.  If one method fails to
work, try another one!  I have had good reliability with the IPX
over Packet driver method, though it can sometimes be a challenge
to get it running...  If you are already using Novell, then the IPX
over ODI might be simpler to set up, though I have found it less
reliable.

        Before I get going, let me plead with everyone NOT TO USE DOOM 1.1
OR 1.0 ON ANY NETWORK OTHERS ARE TRYING TO USE!!  Doom 1.2 is now
available, so please use it rather than 1.1 or 1.0.  DOOM 1.0 and
1.1 really screw up networks.

Now that I have all my disclaimers out of the way... :)

        To use this method of installing IPX you need two files, both of
which are in the file PKTD11.ZIP, which can be had from
oak.oakland.edu as/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip.  I have seen some
problems with this version (11) of the drivers, however, so it
would be wise to test out the packet driver after it is loaded, or
perhaps to try one which comes direct from the ethernet card
manufacturer. (i.e. 3c5x9pd.com from ftp.3com.com)

        If you have problems with these drivers, I have put together a
collection of older versions of IPX and packet drivers which seem
to work better with DOOM.  This package will be uploaded to
ftp.uwp.edu as OLDIPX.ZIP.  (see Chapter [14-6])

        The first file is specific to your ethernet hardware.  It is the
packet driver software that converts packet-driver calls to
commands your ethernet card can understand.  The INSTALL.DOC file
included with the packet driver collection has details about which
cards are supported and what sort of command-line parameters are
needed for each packet driver.  I always load the packet driver
using interrupt 0x60, a popular convention.  These drivers will not
work well under Windows without tweaking, so read the INSTALL.DOC
file for details.  There are also some useful packet utilities
included.  Again details are in INSTALL.DOC.  (Got the hint yet? :)

EXAMPLES:

     3Com 503 card on interrupt 5, I/O port 0x300, and the
     internal transceiver. (twisted pair RJ-45 connector ON
     THE CARD or coaxial BNC connector-- NOT the 15-pin AUI
     connector) The shared memory area is automatically
     determined-- but be sure to exclude the region from your
     expanded memory manager, if used!

          3C503.COM 0x60 0x5 0x300 1

     3Com 509 card: These cards are entirely
     software-configurable through the config/diagnostics on
     your EtherDisk that came with the card.  If you have lost
     the disk, all the needed files are available from
     ftp.3com.com.

          3C509.COM 0x60

     AT&T StarLan cards: Almost like the 503 except the memory
     location must be specified.

          AT&T.COM 0x60 0x2 0x360 0xD000

        Once the packet driver is loaded and reports things correctly
(i.e.it does not give your ethernet address as
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF...) then just run PDIPX.COM to load IPX support.
The PDIPX.COM program is included with PKTD11.ZIP, but it is
contained in a .ZIP file INSIDE of PKTD11.ZIP called PDIPX103.ZIP.
Run the .COM file with no parameters.

        If you have problems with an "invalid mode" when loading PDIPX, you
probably are trying to run other network software at the same time
as the Packet Driver/IPX combination.  Strip down your CONFIG.SYS
and your AUTOEXEC.BAT files to those shown below.  Do not load any
additional TSR's!  Once this bare-bones configuration works, you
can begin adding TSR's.  if your problems persist, try using the
older versions of the packet driver and IPX-to-PD converter.  (They
should be on ftp.uwp.edu.)

        If nothing seems to work, try running the diagnostic program
PKTWATCH.COM after getting everything set up.  If your screen fills
with scrolling multicolor hexadecimal numbers then the packet
driver is working OK.  If it just flashes a cursor at you, then you
have problems UNLESS you are wired directly to another computer.
Hook your computer back up to an active network and see if you can
receive anything then.  If you do not have an active network
available, start DOOM on the OTHER computer while running PKTWATCH
on the original computer.  Of course, the other (sending) computer
needs to have IPX set up as well.

        The simplest way to get all the drivers you need loaded and to
exclude other drivers which may interfere is to create a boot disk
with the correct startup files.  For example:

     CONFIG.SYS
          device=a:\himem.sys
          dos=high,noumb
          files=30
          buffers=30

     AUTOEXEC.BAT
          prompt [DOOM Setup] $p$g
          a:\3c503.com 0x60 0x5 0x300 1
          rem change the above according to your card.
          a:\pdipx.com

        The ONLY line that will vary with what card you have is the
"3c503.com" line.  I encourage you NOT to load an EMS driver since
so many cards use shared memory and it is sometimes difficult to
ensure that the proper area, and only the proper area, is excluded.
DOOM runs just fine with XMS, and you have the added benefit of
loading DOS high to make room for things like mouse drivers.  DOOM
does not NEED XMS to run, though.  Also, I like to change the DOS
prompt to reflect my configuration whenever I am using a bizarre
setup.

        It might be a good idea to also scan your bootable floppy for
viruses BEFORE booting the networked computer with it.  (Scan it on
the NETWORKED computer, not your own...)  There are a number of
common viruses spread by booting computers from infected disks.
(Stoned, Form, and Michelangelo to name a few.)  Let's not give
DOOM a bad name by booting network computers from infected disks!
(btw, F-prot from oak.oakland.edu as /pub/msdos/virus/fp-211.zip is
an EXCELLENT antivirus program. <plug>)

        You must make sure that all of the networked computers using DOOM are
using the same frame type.

*8-3-4*: How can I set up a small inexpensive DOOM network?
-----------------------------------------------------------
        All that is required for network play is four network cards and some
cable.  A server is not nessecary.  Here is a good supply of inexpensive
eight bit network cards for DOOM play.

Corporate Systems Center                PHONE: (408)-734-DISK
1294 Hammerwood Avenue                    FAX: (408)-745-1816
Sunnyvale, CA 94089

"Novell Compatible 8 Bit Coax Ethernet cards at unheard of prices!"

Four brand new cards priced at only $99.00 U.S.

*8-4*: How can I play DOOM by serial link?
==========================================
         DOOM works in two player mode by modem or null modem.  The
minimum baud rate to play DOOM is 9600 bps.
        Shareware versions 1.0 and 1.1 do NOT support play by modem or
serial link.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.2 of DOOM.
        Using this mode is similar to network mode.
        To use a serial link connection, run the DOOM setup and choose "Run
Network/Modem/Serial Game."  Then, choose the type of connection you plan
to make.  Then, configure the game to your liking, and choose the connect
method.
        Note that to run null-modem game, you must have a null-modem cable
plugged into a serial port on both computers and each computer runs
SETUP.EXE with identical parameters.
        If you are using a modem, you will most likely need to edit the
MODEM.CFG file in the DOOM directory.  The first line of the file is an
initialization string.  Pull out your modem manual, and do the following.

        (1) Find the code that turns off error correction.
        (2) Find the code that turns off data compression.
        (3) Find the code that locks your modem at 9600 baud.
        (4) Find the code that turns off all hardware and software flow
            control.
        (5) Create an "AT" initialization string with all these codes and
            put it into the MODEM.CFG.

        To find an already created initialization string for your modem, look
in Chapter [18-3] of this FAQ.  If one is not listed for your modem, you will
have to dig up your modem manual for the correct settings.
        The second line is a hangup strings used when you quit DOOM.
        If you STILL cannot get the modems to connect, both of you should
run your favorite terminal programs, and connect with 9600, no error
correction, no data compression, and NO HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL.  Then just run
SETUP.EXE with the "Alreay Connected" option in the configuration box.

*8-5*: How can I play DOOM over the Internet?
=============================================
        Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by Jim
Knutson.  With this brilliant little piece of code, multiplayer gaming has
soared to new heights.  With IHHD, you'll be able to play Head to Head
against other human opponents all over the world, with the only cost to you
being the regular prices you pay to connect to or use your Internet host.
Best of all, it's free.

        First of all, your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  If you aren't sure what your host is running for its operating
system, check the information given at the login prompt or send mail to
your administrator.

        Other than that, you should be able to run IHHD with ease.  Your
first order of business is to get the IHHD software.  It is available via
anonymous FTP at "cactus.org" in the "pub/IHHD" directory.

        To get it:

        (1) FTP to cactus.org  (Type "ftp cactus.org" at the UNIX prompt)
        (2) At the login prompt, enter "anonymous"
        (3) At the password prompt, enter your E-mail address
        (4) At the command prompt, type "cd pub/IHHD"
        (5) Type "binary"
        (6) Type "get IHHD.1.6.4.shar"
        (7) Type "quit"

        If you followed the above steps, you should now have the
IHHD.1.6.4.shar file in your home directory.  Type "ls" at your host's
command prompt to verify its existence.  If you don't see it, try the
above steps again or call for help.

        Next, if you've successfully retrieved the "IHHD.1.6.4.shar" file
from "cactus.org," you need to prepare the IHHD to run on your UNIX system.
For UNIX veterans, the "IHHD.1.6.4.shar" file is in fact a shar file, and
contains a makefile for easy compiling on your system.  For the rest of
us, follow these steps to get the IHHD up and running:

        (1) Create a directory to put the IHHD software in.
            Type "mkdir IHHD" at the command prompt.
        (2) Move the IHHD file to the new directory.
            Type "mv IHHD.1.6.4.shar ~/IHHD"
        (3) Go to the IHHD directory.
            Type "cd IHHD"
        (4) Unpack the IHHD files.
            Type "sh IHHD.1.6.4.shar"
        (5) Compile the IHHD software to run on your system.
            Type "make"
        (6) You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory.
            The important filenames you're looking for should be:
                "dialer"
                "tcpdialer"
                "tcpanswer"
                "call"
                "showlog"
        (7) If you've got these, you're cool.  Otherwise, try the above
            steps again, re-retrieve the "IHHD.1.6.4.shar" file from
            "cactus.org" using the instructions above, or call for help.

If everything checks out, you're ready to rumble!

Here's how you get connected using IHHD:

        (1) Set up a time to play with another Internet AW player.
            Ideally, you should use E-mail to make the prior arrangements.

            Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate and line
            settings for your modems.

            Make sure data compression on your modem is off, if you have such
            a feature.  Look at the modem initialization strings section in
            this FAQ for more help.

        (2) When it's time to play, start your favorite terminal program
            and call up your Internet host using your modem.  Make sure that
            your baud rate and line settings correspond to your opponent's.

        (3) Login to your Internet host normally.

        (4) Contact the other player by sending a short E-mail message
            indicating that you are on the net and ready to play.

        (5) Once you both establish that you're there and ready to go,
            return to your UNIX prompt.

        (6) Type "cd IHHD" to enter your IHHD directory.

        (7) You may have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it
            activated already.

        (8) Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection.
            For example, if you were playing against knuston@cactus.org,
            you would type "dialer cactus.org" to initiate the connection.

            Another way is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
            opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Or reverse roles, where
            you type "tcpdialer -answer" while your opponent types "tcpdialer
            your.host".  Don't ask me what the difference is; I don't know.

            So, to recap, there are two methods of IHHD connection.
            Method 1: dialer.  You each type "dialer other.guy's.host"
            Method 2: tcpdialer.  One of you types "tcpdialer other.guy's.host"
                      while the other types "tcpdialer -answer".

        (9) Regardless of which method you use to connect, type short text
            messages followed by a carriage return until you see your opponent
            acknowledge you.

       (10) If you don't see you opponent after a resonable amout of time,
            exit dialer or tcpdialer by pressing "CTRL-C" (i.e. hitting
            the "ctrl" and "c" key simultaneously.)  Contact your opponent
            again by E-mail and agree to try the other method of
            connecting.

       (11) If you're connection looks fine and your opponent has acknowledged
            you and you have acknowledged him, exit your terminal program
            and change to your DOOM directory.  Run SETUP.EXE, and select
            "Run Network/Modem/Serial Game."  On the next menu, choose
            "Modem."  Finally, configure all of the options to your liking,
            select "Already Connected," and press F10.

       (12) If everything goes well, DOOM will start up and bring you to
            your first game over the Internet!  Congratulations, you are
            now connected by IHHD.  You can now proceed to play DOOM as if
            you were connected via a regular phone line.

        If you are having trouble getting DOOM to work with your modem, you
may want to download S4DOOM12.ZIP (see Chapter [14-3] to help you with the
connection.

        Unfortunately, because of the nature of the Internet, delays and
warping may occur with your IHHD connection, depending on the quality of the
connection between your and your opponent's host machines.  These delays
are often sporadic, and depend largely on what's going on on the Internet
at that particular times.  Then again, you might just be extremely unlucky
and have a cruddy Internet connection.

        To gauge the quality of the connection, try to "ping" your opponent's
computer from your host.  At the UNIX prompt, type "ping -s opponent's.host".
You should get a listing of "ping times", which you may stop at any time by
pressing "CTRL-C".  Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of
how much ping times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of the
connection between your host and your opponent's.

        Also, while you're flying via an IHHD connection, try hitting "ESC-Q"
to see the ratio of acknowledged packets versus rejected packets.  Of course,
the less rejected packets you get, the better.

        Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got a
cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've got a good
connection.

        If all else fails, burn incense and sacrifice a beautiful young virgin
princess to the net.gods.  No, wait.  Better yet, send me a virgin.  E-mail
me for an address.

*8-5-1*: How can I play DOOM over the Internet at 14.4k?
--------------------------------------------------------
        Here is the best and only way to get DOOM to run at 14.4k baud over
the IHHD (Internet-Head-to-Head-Daemon).  You may want to grab S4DOOM12.ZIP
to help you with modem connections.  (see Chapter [14-3])

        You must have a good modem INIT string that works with DOOM.
Look in the modem initialization chapter of this FAQ (Chapter [18-3]) for an
init string that may work with your modem.  Otherwise, you may have to
experiment.  Before trying 14.4k, test this at 9600 first.

        Then, once you've played DOOM at 9600 baud over IHHD, then you can
start fiddling with 14.4k to get a faster and smoother play action.

        First, if you got S4DOOM12.ZIP, unzip it into your DOOM directory.
Then edit SDOOM.BAT and search and replace all "9600"'s to "19200"'s.  You
may want to make a backup of this file for 9600 baud play.

        Enter your terminal program and change your modem settings to
be 19200,N81.  Continue from step (3) in Chapter [8-5] to connect.  If you
got S4DOOM12.ZIP, run SDOOM.BAT instead of SETUP.EXE in step (11).

        A good test to see if you are connected correctly with the other
player is to try to send a file about 50-100k with Zmodem to the person that
is connected with you over IHHD.  A few CRC errors are expected due to
such high speeds and no hardware error correction.  However, it should
be able to get at least halfway through.  My point is, if the transfer
does not get any blocks sent, then DOOM is certainly not going to work right.

=SECTION TWO= CHEATS AND SPOILERS
=================================

-------------------------------------
CHAPTER *9*: How can I cheat in DOOM?
-------------------------------------

[9-1]: What are the DOOM cheat codes?
=====================================
        Here is a list of the cheat codes from DOOM.  During play, just type
the codes in with the keyboard.  You need not hit ENTER after the code.
After entering, a message should be displayed at the top of the screen
telling which cheat mode was activated.

iddqd           Degreelessness mode (God mode)
idkfa           Very Happy Ammo (full ammo, 200% armor, all weapons)
idspispopd      No clipping (you can walk through walls)
idbehold        Displays menu (followed by S, V, I, R, A, or L for choice)
idclev          Warp (followed by episode number and level number)
idmypos         Displays your coordinates in hex
idchoppers      Gives you the chain saw (long story behind the message)
iddt            Toggles Automap between normal, full, and full with objects
                (enter when looking at the Automap)

*9-2*: How do I use the "devparm" parameter?
============================================
        Well, looks like all of the FAQ readers had a field day on this one!
I received a HUGE amount of E-mail on this parameter, explaining everything
anyone could find.  To use this parameter, start DOOM by typing:
"doom -devparm <parameter> <more parameters>".  Most of these parameters can
be mixed and matched to create different effects.  For instance, typing
"doom -devparm -wart 1 8 -record demo01 -timedemo" would record a demo
on episode one, level eight, in slow motion.  The "-devparm" parameter is
not required to play back a recorded demo, use three screen mode, or use
the "-file" parameter.  Lastly, typing F1 during development mode will
allow a 256 color screen capture in PCX format.

-devparm                       Puts you in developers mode
-wart <episode> <level>        Adds an external file "ExMy.WAD" to filelist
-warp <episode> <level>        Warps to episode (1-3) level (1-9)
-skill <skill level>           Starts on skill level (1-4)
-episode <episode>             Starts on episode (1-3)
-loadgame <game number>        Starts from a saved game (1-6)
-file <name w/ .LMP/.WAD>      Adds external WAD/LMP files to the filelist
-playback <name w/o .LMP>      Plays back a recorded demo
-playdemo <name w/o .LMP>      Plays back a recorded demo - Difference?
-record <name w/o .LMP>        Makes a demo recording until you finish or die
-timedemo <name w/o .LMP>      Calculates the number of times the screen is
                               redrawn when playing a demo.
-noview                     ** Turns of screen and displays game-tics
-nodraw                     ** Speeds up game on some systems?
-noblit                     ** Speeds up game on some systems?
-left                        * Sets up a network terminal for the "left view"
-right                       * Sets up a network terminal for the "right view"
-watch <parameter>             Used in network play?
-drone <player number>         Creates a drone of another player
-recordfrom <1-6> <demo name>  Records a demo from a saved game
-config                        Reads an alternate configuration file
-debugfile <parameter>         Dumps all debugging info to debug<parm>.txt
-file                          Adds a filename to the .WAD file

*: If you have a network, try setting up a network game with three players.
   The three terminals should have the parameters:
                "doom -devparm -net 3 -left"
                "doom -devparm -net 3"
                "doom -devparm -net 3 -right"
   Then, set up the left and right terminal monitors next to the middle
   monitor, in a virtual-reality type configuration.  When you turn your
   head, you see the screen turned 90 degrees!  Interesting way to play.

**: Can only be used with the "-timedemo" parameter.

        If anyone has any idea what the "unknown" or question marked
parameters do, send me some E-mail!

*9-2-1*: What do the dots that appear in development mode mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------
        The dots represent the game's animation rate: the frames per
second.  The formula to convert dots to frames per second is:

                                 70
                        --------------------
                        <NUMBER OF DOTS> + 1

        This chapter is full of spoilers for people who are "stuck" in the
game.  Enjoy!

[10-1]: Where are the DOOM secret levels?
=========================================

[10-1-1]: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------
        You must be on level three to access the secret level in DOOM.
First, there is a room with an elevator with armor on it in the northwest
corner of the map.  Press the red button in this room. This opens a corridor
in the room where you can see a glowing sphere.  The room it leads to has
some lighted alcoves.  Walk up the stairs.  You should be able to hear a
mechanical sound.  This is the sound of two alcoves being lowered.  The map
looks similar to this drawing.  (I love the beauty of ASCII art)

                        Alcove 1 /\ /\
                                 \/    \
                                /   /\   \
                              /     /  \   \
                            /   /\/      \   \
                            \   \        /   /
                            /\   \    /    /
                            \/ \   \/      \
                        Alcove 2 \     /\    \
                                   \/     \    \
                                            \    \
                                              \ x
                                             ENTRANCE

        Walking into this room normally, the alcoves rise before you can see
them.  But, if you run up the stairs to one of the alcoves fast enough,
you can get in it and rise to a secret door.  Alcove 2 leads to the
blue glowing sphere.  Alcove 1 leads to an island surrounded by ooze.
You can get a rocket launcher here.  In alcove 1, follow the ooze down
the tunnel.  The tunnel leads to a switch that raises the bridge over the
opening ooze pit.  A secret door is also near the switch, but the bridge
leads to the secret exit.  REMEMBER TO *BOOK* TO THE ALCOVE! :)

*10-2*: Where are the secret doors in DOOM?
===========================================
        The following was written by the Dutch Wouter Slegers.  This is
not quite complete, because work was discontinued.  There were some dutch
comments, and I have done my best to "decode" them.  I hope everything
is understandable!  And again, thanks to Wouter Slegers for this great
piece of work.

*10-2-1*: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------

BEGINNING:

* Just after the zigzag look right for the oddly colored wall.  Push it for
  armor.
* After you cleaned out the exit room, go back to the zigzag room and look
  right for the shotgun.
* For DOOM v1.2, a secret area has been added next to the nukage zigzag.

NUCLEAR PLANT:

* To the east there is a secret door in the northern corner of the stairs.
  However, it appears to be one-way (from outside to the inside only).
* Directly behind the red door, follow the turn right.  You'll see an
  indention to your left.  If you step on it, it will move away.  You will
  find aliens to your right, and you will also see the chainsaw.
* A bit ahead you'll see a lift.  Push the first panel to your left. You'll
  be able to kill those Imps from the ridge.
* In the maze (south part), shoot the middle most western wall (the one
  behind the green armor) for access to the chainsaw. (push the switch in NW
  to get it).  Some extra armor is hidden behind the eastern wall in the
  northeastern corner of the stairs.
* In the maze (south part), push the wall between the white stripes for a
  backpack and rocket launcher.

TOXIC REFINARY:

* Directly in front of you is a secret door.  The switch for the drawbridge
  is in one of the chambers described below.
* In the NW are TWO secret passages (the second niche on your left and on
  your right), both will open when you're on the stairs but will close again
  after a short while.  Go to the stairs and then run like hell.
* In the northern (rocket launcher) is a secret room in the right corner (in
  the green stuff).  Run fast for minimum damage.  You'll see the switch for
  the drawbridge at the beginning.  To the east is the exit (a lighter
  colored wall part) through another secret chamber containing the chaingun.
* In the south-eastern is a supercharger (pull the switch on the pillar).
* The drawbridge should be lowered now.  Cross it, but be carefull! There are
  a lot of aliens lurking behind automaticaly opening doors. My tactic is to
  select the chain gun, run forward and back up as soon as you hear the doors
  open.  Then take them out at your leisure.
* In the north is a corridor, follow it to find the hidden-level-switch.
* To the north is a elevator, push the wall.
* Behind the blue door in the eastern corner is a secret door.  The chainsaw,
  a supercharger and a partial invisibility is available.

MILITARY BASE:

* In the northeast is a pentagram on the floor. If you touch it, numerous
  enemies will warp in.  Try walking around it and then running to the
  corridor.  That way you can pick them off one by one.
* In the east there is a lift at the eastern wall.  Goodies are at your left.
* Also in the east is a lift/trapdoor in the SW-corner.
* The same area is accessable via the lift/trapdoor in the NE-corner in the
  south.
* In the north, push the wall in the east.  You'll get into a chamber with
  several high pillars.  The pillar at the far side of the room lowers when
  someone is on the stairs.  Just run on it, wait for it to rise, and 'jump'
  to the other pillars by running fast counter clockwise.
* To get to the end of level switch, run down the trench.  To the left is a
  isle with the switch and to the right is the lift upstairs.

COMMAND CONTROL:

* The light wall to the left in the beginning (before the door) hides a
  backpack.
* Two platforms with Imps behind the yellow keycard door act as elevator in
  DOOM v1.2.  The right one leads to a secret room and shortcut to the
  darkroom.
* The south exit from the round chamber (the one with the radiation suits)
  leads to a trench.  Follow the trench east for the rocket launcher and a
  supercharger.  Go west to get out.

PHOVOS LAB:

* The chamber in the middle (behind the first stairs) has a secret chamber
  to the north (behind the drums).
* Go right.  In the SE-corner of the acid is a secret passage (the other
  colored wall).  There is a rocket launcher and blue armor.
* In the NW is a chamber with two pillars and an isle with a switch in the
  green stuff. In the indention in the west is a secret chamber with the
  antiradiation suit. The south wall of this chamber hides the chainsaw and
  that south wall gives away to let you outside and get the supercharger.
  You can get the blue armor in the NE-corner by stepping on the northern
  pillar when it's down, waiting until it rises again and then 'jumping'
  over.
* In the north eastern chamber (the one with the blue floor and the blinking
  light) has a secret chamber to the south with a backpack and computer map.
* In the northern chamber is a partially hidden chamber to the SW.  The best
  way to get there is to follow the wall left.  You'll find the night vision,
  which is very useful in sniping those baddies in the dark.
* In the northern chamber the top of the /\ in the middle is also a secret
  door, but as far as I can see this isn't really usefull (maybe for dashing
  for the exit?)

CENTRAL PROCESSING:

* At the first 'crossing' you encounter, look in the NE corner.  There is a
  partially hidden chamber with some ammo, health and a green armor. There
  are also some fireballs there, so to be safe, shoot a rocket in it to
  detonate the barrels and kill them.
* Just before you are by the blue door there is a secret chamber to the
  south.  Before you're at the blue door, there's be a tower.  When you reach
  the blue door it will lower so you can get in.  It has a secret door in the
  south.  You'll find a backpack, a radiation suit, and partial
  invisibility.
* In the same area to the north is a corridor.  It will open when you get the
  yellow key.
* Behind the red door in the southwest is a green lake.  In the NE-corner
  is an anti-radiation-suit.  In the 'middle' (SW) is a assortment of
  armor.  In the SE-corner is a nightvision, a partial invisibility and the
  exit.
* In the most eastern corridor is a colored wall.  Push it to get the
  computer map.

COMPUTER STATION:

* In the southwest is a pillar that will descend when you are on the stairs
  to the east of it.  Go stand on top of it to jump on the ledge in the NE
  for the computer map and in the southeast for the chaingun and a backpack.
  Jump in the lake in the north and run fastly to the tunnel in the NW.  In
  the west of that tunnel is a radiation-suit and in the east are some
  goodies and a switch.  Throwing the switch will allow you to get to the
  chainsaw in the southeast.  Leave the tunnel via the north and look behind
  the pillar in that lake for blue armor.  Follow the acid to the north to the
  supercharger and leave via the east.
* After you get the blue key in the northwest, two doors will open with
  aliens.  The one in the middle has a false wall to the east which leads to
  the outside and to partial invisibility.

PHOBOS ANAMOLY:

* The only secret room is in the east in the corridor leading to the first
  door.  Note that there is a map in the east.


*10-2-2*: The Shores of Hell
----------------------------

DEIMOS ANAMOLY:

* In the SW is a indention with two skull-switches. Press the eastern first
  for access to a teleporter to a corridor filled with bonusses in the north.
* The SE-corner of big room in middle (the one with the windows to the east,
  the south and the west) turns into a teleporter to the plasma-gun after you
  pull the switch on the outer west side and push the button on the west side
  of the little wall that rises out of the floor. (the east switch opens the
  passage to the red key).
* Behind the red door is a blue mega armor and the computer map.

CONTAINMENT AREA:

* If you walk along the south border of the storage area (the one with all
  those boxes), you'll bump into a box which will lower to reveal some
  shotgun ammo.
* In the south east quadrant are three circles with parts going up and down.
  The north one has a secret corridor in the north leading to the blue door
  in the north, filled with life-bonusses.
* In the SW area (with three corridors with the blue lights on the ground and
  ceiling) is a partially hidden corridor in the NW corner of the most western
  corridor. When you try to get the backpack, the way behind you will close and
  the wall in front of you will lower, spilling some fireballs. The door behind
  you will open after a while. The SE corner (the black-colored wall) gives
  access to a small chamber. The SE corner of that small chamber (the wall with
  the small green light) hides a corridor back to non-hidden territory. The
  most south part of that corridor (the black wall part) gives away to a
  computermap.
* In the south middle quadrant is a room with two pillars, one kaki, one
  with tubes (to get there leave the three corridors with the blue lights
  via the way you came in. Turn right and first left. The room on your left
  [east] is the one you seek). The west (kaki) pillar has a switch on the
  north side, with which you can lower the eastern pillar to get the plasma
  gun.
* In the south middle quadrant is a corridor with skullcrushing doors. To
  get by them, run forward as soon as they start to go up. Take them one at
  a time. The middle one (third from either side) has a secret passage in the
  north ridge, leading to the chainsaw. When you get it the flaming skulls
  will try to get you from hidden rooms in the south and east.
* The yellow key in the south middle has a bridge following blue lights, just
  walk there and back fast.
* The western room behind the yellow door contains the chaingun, just flip
  the switch!
* In the eastern room behind the yellow door you'll see three rooms to your
  right and three pillars will rise in the north.  The eastern pillar opens
  the middle door containing the rocket launcher.  Flip the middle switch-
  in the south chamber and the west switch in north chamber.  Pull all
  switches after each other.  The other rooms contain aliens.

This encompasses 91% of the secrets on this level.

REFINERY:
* The first room in the east contains a radiation suit, chaingun, and
  goodies.
* In the SW is a corridor to the room with the blue key containing the
  plasma gun. To get there leave the blue room and turn right twice.  Walk
  straight ahead until you see a red blood lake.  Jump in and run north
  (right) fast.
* In the south east is a partially hidden cage with fireballs.  You can enter
  via the NW corner to get the backpack.
* Follow the corridor behind the blue door through the open area and the room
  with all those pillars and blinking light to the green toxic stuff.  If you
  go around the corner in the SE, you will find a radiation suit.  In the
  middle of the eastern wall of the green stuff is a corridor to a room with
  the supercharger in the NE corner.

This encompasses 83% of the secrets on this level.

DEIMOS ANAMOLY:
* In the middle of the south wall of the beginning room (before it widens),
  illuminated by light, hides a shotgun.
* Take the teleporter to big room. In the north is a elevator.  Press the
  head left of it to go up. You'll see a green armor and a computermap.
  To get them push in the NE corner.
* To the north of the big O formed green toxic waste is a secret door open if
  you do not use the west exit.  There is a supercharger and radiation
  suit.
* To the west of the big O with green toxic waste is a corridor with a T to the
  north. To the east of that corridor is a secret wall with a partial
  invisibility and a chaingun. Shoot the wall to get them.
* In the great round corridor in north: In the east is a dent in the ring. This
  is a trapdoor with a secret door to the east and leeds to a plasma gun and a
  teleport to the middle of the great round corridor.
* In the great round corridor in the north: follow NE corridor to a room with
  lava. In NE corner behind the lava is a secret door. Warning! the SE branch
  of that way leeds to a crushing ceiling. Outrun it and push green wallpatch
  in the east for the exit. The SW branch lets you go back to the lavaroom.
  The SW door of that lavaroom leeds to a mega armor surrounded by drums (in
  the SW corner of the toxic waste).
* In the south middle is a small high path above the acid.  In the SW is a
  berserker.
* Before you exit, look back and get the supercharger

This encompasses 80% of the secrets on this level.

COMMAND CENTER:

* The room where the first door leeds to has two secret rooms in the space
  between the room and the stairs.  The doors are in the south and will open
  automaticly to reveile aliens and ammo.
* The ridge in the east of the room (in the middle south) leeds to a green
  armor and some baddies.
* The ridge in the west is also travelable.
* In the SW is a roughly (--) shaped room.  In the W room is a switch which
  allows you to walk through the fake fire in the NW corner.  The teleporter
  takes you to a firehead infested area. The wall with the head leads
  to another room with transporter.  That transporter takes you to the
  switch for the secret level.
* The south middle quadrant is behind a big pillar and door.
  Go through it to a room with doors in all directions.  Take the east.  In
  that room is a secret door in the NE corner (near the cozy head-fire) for a
  chainsaw.
* A raditaion suit is guarded by a minitaur in the room in the trap
  circular staircase.
* In the north is a long green toxic corridor leading to C formed green lake
  in the west.  In the north of that lake is a door (behind the clip).
  Follow it to a green minotaur.  Further north is a lake with a pillar in
  the middle on which there is a plasma gun.

This encompasses 90% of the secrets on this level.

FORTRESS OF MYSTERY:

Secrets in this level are unknown.

HALLS OF THE DAMNED:
* SE corner behind the brown wall there is some ammo.

This encompasses 66% of the secrets.

SPAWNING VATS:

* In the SW is a room with a radiation shield ans small patches of green
  acid in indentions along the walls.  The SW indention has a corridor to
  the south leading to a chamber with a teleporter.  The teleporter will get
  you to a red door, with a switch behind it.  Pushing that switch will open
  a secret room in the beginning-room (SE corner).  The red key is in the
  middle south on a pillar in the south VAC-chamber at the east
  blue-corridor.
* In the NW is a room with enemies.  The third indention is a corridor
  leading to a very dark open patch.  In the NE is a switch to some ammo
  and in the SW is the plasma gun.

TOWER OF BABEL:

Secrets in this level are unknown.

*10-2-3*: Inferno
-----------------

HELL KEEP

* Behind the door to hell follow the road left.  When you come out of the
  tunnel the wall to the SE is fake, and leads to lava and blood.  A
  shotgun may be found around here.
* In the north after the long corridor to the west is a small room with
  grey walls behind a big chamber with lava like walls and small
  pedestals.  The small chamber has a rocket launcher in the west.

SLOUGH OF DESPAIR:

* To get a chaingun, follow the wall to your right (west) to the chaingun
  behind the wall.  The wall will lower when you walk over the red patch to
  its west side.
* The second finger from the east has some cages with enemies.  To get into
  those cages, walk over the red triangle.  The floors of the cages lowers
  and a wall behind you will come down.
* The plasma gun is hidden in the western part of the pillar you see when you
  stand with your back to the second finger from the west.

PANDEMONIUM:

* The BFG9000 is in the SE of the lava in the middle.  (the lava is
  accessable from the room from where you oversee the east-west oriented
  corridor.)
* One of the most northern chambers has two air shafts next to a formation
  you could describe as a coach facing north.   When you stand on it the
  wall part west of the stairs south will lower allowing you to get the
  map.  The wall part east of the stairs will lower when you push it.

This encompasses 83% of the secrets on this level.

HOUSE OF PAIN:

* In the area with the bloodriver and the drums in the west, there is a
  ammo dump behind the east wall in the SE corner.

This encompasses 25% of the secrets on this level.

UNHOLY CATHEDRAL:

* In the cathedral are four 2x2-teleport-places.  The northern two are
  connected to the north by a corridor.  That corridor has a secret passage
  in the NW.
* In the east is the room to the exit (in the north) and a door to the
  east.  The east door leeds to a room where many enemies warp in.  To the
  east of that room, behind the skull, is the BFG9000.

This encompasses 50% of the secrets on this level.

MT. EREBUS:

* In the north is a NW-SE oriented structure with two cages with Imps at
  both sides of the entrance.  That structure has a secret door inside in
  the middle of the NE wall and a teleporter in the middle of the SW wall.
  The teleporter will put you on a high structure further north.  From
  there you can 'jump' and get the chainsaw.
* The exit is north of the beginning-point behind a blue door.

This encompasses 50% of the secrets on this level.

GATE TO LIMBO:

* The central blood lake with the pillar surrounded by medikits is hollow
  and the red door leeds to a yellow door.  That yellow door opens the door
  you can see in the NE.  To get to that door take the teleporter behind the
  red door in the NW lake.
* In the SW is a great blood lake.  Behind the big piller in the NW of it is
  a red door leading to a teleporter.  Go into the teleporter for some
  goodies.
* In the NW is also a bloodlake with a red door leading via a transporter
  to the yellow door behind the exit.
* The middle north (blood lake north of central lake with pillar) has
  radiation suits in the SE corner and red doors in the north of both
  pillars.
* The western red door leads via a teleporter to a switch.  Push it to
  lower the edge so you can get the yellow key.  The eastern red door also
  leads you to the same area.

This encompasses 75% of the secrets on this level.

NOTE: Many levels do not have complete secret door descriptions.  You may want
      to check out the DOOM maps.  If you are willing to write a complete
      description on all of the doors on a level, please E-mail me.

[10-3]: When should I use each weapon?
======================================
FIST:  Never use unless you have Berserk.  This is really cool, but not as
good as the chain saw.

CHAIN SAW:  Good for tight corners.  Rips apart the Demons and Spectres.
This is probably the beast weapon for non-shooting enemies.

PISTOL:  Average weapon.  Does damage to the Former Humans, but the shotgun is
preferred.

SHOTGUN:  This is probably the best all around weapon.  Use this much of
the time as it is very powerful.  Its only problem is that its rapid fire
is not very fast.

CHAINGUN:  Weak weapon for most enemies because it takes a fair amount of
time to kill them.  Good for a lot of monsters in a row.

ROCKET LAUNCHER:  Good for occasional long shots at many enemies in one
place.  Be careful, however, this weapon can hurt you as well if the
rocket bursts at close range.

PLASMA RIFLE:  Rapid fires very quickly.  Hurts some enemies a lot, and
others not as much.

BFG9000:  The most powerful weapon.  Kills almost ANY enemy in one shot,
but uses a lot of energy cells and rapid fire is very slow.

[10-4]: Where can I get the chain saw on episode one?
=====================================================
        The chain saw can be found on level two of mission one. Here's how
to get it.

(1) Hit the switch surrounded by the acid.
(2) Go through the door that the switch opened.  This will take you to a
    "computer maze."
(3) On the WEST side of the maze, look for a secret door.  Listen for the
    sound the character makes when looking for a door.  When you find a
    section of wall where he doesn't make the sound, shoot the wall.
(4) Follow the passage which was opened.
(5) Activate the red button in the large room.


*10-5*: How powerful is the ammunition?
=======================================

1 Ammo                  =   1 point of damage
1 Shotgun               =   7 points (fires 7 pellets at 1 point per pellet)
                            (not every pellet will hit every target)
1 Berserk               =   10 points
1 Cell (Plasma Rifle)   =   2 points
1 Rocket                = * 20 points
1 BFG9000               = * 50 points

*: Rockets and BFG9000 shots have an area effect.  The direct hit values
   are given above.

*10-6*: How many shots does it take to kill each enemy?
=======================================================
        Here is a chart that show that amount of each kind of ammunition it
takes to kill enemies.  This chart pertains to Ultra-Violence mode.

resource, you can view it in 320x200x256 VGA mode.  You can also
export it to a file (an LBM if it's a graphic resource), or replace
it by importing a file.  And, if you're really brave, you can export
all the resources in the WAD file to individual files.

CHAPTER *16*: Why won't DOOM work correctly?
--------------------------------------------
        This chapter helps you if you cannot game the game to function as it
should.

[16-1]: How can I use SMARTDRV.EXE with DOOM?
=============================================
         Some people have been complaining about problems with DOOM and
SMARTDRV.EXE.  DOOM is not completely compatible with SMARTDRV.EXE, but
here is how you can get it to work.  Try putting the following command in
your CONFIG.SYS (This will not work in the AUTOEXEC.BAT):

            DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE DOUBLE_BUFFER

        The double buffering uses memory differently than the normal
SMARTDRV.EXE commands.  This command will take up 2k of conventional RAM and
cannot be loaded into high memory.  This has been tested on two machines that
did not work with SMARTDRV.EXE, and this corrected the problem.

[16-2]: Why am I getting an "OUT OF MEMORY" error with DOOM?
============================================================
        If you are receiving an "OUT OF MEMORY" error when attempting to run
DOOM, you might want to attempt any of the following:

        (1) DOOM requires at least 4mb of RAM.  Check to make sure you have
at least this amount.
        (2) If you are using MS-DOS 6.0, try holding down the LEFT SHIFT key
during bootup.  This will stop all your TSRs from loading.  Remember to
reinstall your mouse driver, however.
        (3) If you are using MS-DOS 5.0, rename your AUTOEXEC.BAT to stop all
your TSRs from booting.
        (4) If you are using MS-DOS 6.0, try running MEMMAKER to free up more
RAM at bootup time.
        (5) Try running DOOM without using HIMEM and EMM386.  If you are
using a different memory manager, try removing it instead.

[16-3]: Why does DOOM crash when I start it?
============================================
        Your motherboard may not be compatible with the DOS extender that
DOOM uses.  Try getting DOOM v1.1.  If that still does not work, try running
DOOM with one of the DOS extenders in the file "altdoom1.zip".  See Chapter
[6] for more information on how to get these files.

[16-4]: How can I run DOOM under OS/2?
======================================
        People have been having a lot of trouble getting DOOM v1.2 to work
under OS/2.  id Software is working on a way to allow it to work.

*16-5*: Why does DOOM access the disk so much?
==============================================
        To run with enough memory to eliminate disk accesses while in a
mission for the smoothest play possible requires 3600K free XMS if
no soundcard is used, or 4200 free XMS if a soundcard is used.

        To run with enough disk cache to eliminate disk accesses while in a
mission for the smoothest play possible requires a 1000K disk cache
if no soundcard is used, or 1600K if a soundcard is used.

        One way to achieve this is to have this command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file that caches reads from drive C (assuming that's where DOOM resides),
does *not* delay writes, and establishes a 1600K disk cache:

    SMARTDRV C 1600

        A bigger cache is certainly allowable, but in any event, the free
XMS *after* installing SMARTDRV must still be at least 2800K.  If not, you
must reduce the SMARTDRV cache size until 2800K free XMS is available.

-----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER *17*: Why won't my sound card work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------

        This chapter helps fix problems with various sound cards in DOOM.

[17-1]: Why won't my Sound Blaster v1.0 or v1.5 work with DOOM?
===============================================================
        The v1.0 shareware release of DOOM does not work correctly with
earlier versions of the Sound Blaster.  It is recommended that you receive
v1.2 of DOOM to fix this problem.  Information on getting this upgrade is
available in Chapter [6].
        If you insist on using v1.0 of DOOM, here is two different ways to
fix your problem, although they are not guaranteed to work on all computers.

        (1)  If you have a turbo button on your computer, turn it off.  Run
DOOM, and when the title screen appears, turn it back on.
        (2)  Disable the internal cache.

*17-2*: Why won't my Sound Blaster Pro work with DOOM?
======================================================
        If you are using an older graphics card that supports HiColor (16
bit graphics) you may have trouble getting this to work correctly.  The
only recommendation is to borrow a friend's graphics card.

[17-3]: Why won't my Gravis UltraSound work with DOOM?
======================================================
        To get DOOM to run properly with both music and
digitized sound effects on the Gravis UltraSound, try these three steps.

        (1) Set your ULTRASND environment variable.

    example:  SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5

        (2) DOOM requires that you have installed the General MIDI patch set
from the 2.06 Install Disks that came with your UltraSound (these are also
available on various FTPs and BBSs).  DOOM will find your patches (using the
ULTRADIR variable) in the MIDI subdirectory.  Place the following command in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

    example:  SET ULTRADIR=C:\ULTRASND

        (3) You will also need to copy ULTRAMID.INI into your DOOM directory
and rename it DMXGUS.INI.  (this file is also available via FTP)

*17-4*: Why won't my Pro Audio Spectrum 16 work with DOOM?
==========================================================
        You may be using an older version of DOOM such as v1.0 or v1.1.
Get DOOM v1.2 for full PAS-16 support in native mode.
        If the game is locking up after the "HU Init" line, there is a
solution.  Make sure you are loading your PAS MVPRODD.SYS driver low.
Loading it high can cause DOOM to lock up.

*17-5*: Why won't my ATI Stereo-F/X work with DOOM?
===================================================
        Turning off DMA buffering in the sound card's SFX.EXE
configuration program should fix this problem.

-----------------------------------------
CHAPTER *18*: Miscellaneous DOOM problems
-----------------------------------------

*18-1*: Why won't my mouse work with DOOM?
==========================================

*18-1-1*: Why does my mouse start moving itself during play?
------------------------------------------------------------
        Older mouse drivers cause a problem for DOOM.  Make sure you are
using Microsoft mouse drivers v9.x instead of v8.x.  Logitech mouse drivers
v6.x work as well.  The newest Logitech mouse drivers are available at the
FTP site "wuarchive.wustl.edu" in the directory
"/systems/ibmpc/msdos/mouse" under the file name "drvr624.zip."

[18-1-2]: Why won't my two button mouse work with DOOM?
-------------------------------------------------------
        DOOM's SETUP.EXE program assumes that one has a three button mouse.
The left button is "fire," the right button is "forward," and the center
button is "strafe."  If you run the setup program that comes with DOOM, you
can assign "strafe" to the right mouse button, and the setting for "Move
Forward" then appears to be blank. In actuality, "Move Forward" is set to be
permanently "on." This can be fixed easily.  Edit the file "DEFAULT.CFG" in
your DOOMDATA directory (C:\DOOMDATA\DEFAULT.CFG by default) with any ASCII
(text) editor.  The three lines of interest are: mouseb_fire, mouseb_strafe,
and mouseb_forward. The settings for these are 0 (left button), 1 (middle
button) and 2 (right button).  When you ran the setup program, mouseb_forward
was assigned a value of -1.  Go ahead and change this to "1", save the file
and restart DOOM.  The final entries should appear as:

mouseb_fire      0
mouseb_strafe    2
mouseb_forward   1

        This will allow you to shoot with the left button and strafe with the
right button.

*18-1-3*: Why won't my IBM PS/2 mouse work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------
        The IBM PS/2 mouse does not seem to work well with DOOM.  id
Software is working on a solution to this problem.  The only current
solution that has been discovered is to load DOOM under Windows.  Doing
this allows the mouse to work perfectly.

*18-2*: Why does netDOOM seem to crash at certain times?
========================================================
        This is a known bug, and id Software is working on a fix.

*18-3*: Why won't my modem work with DOOM?
==========================================
        You may use a non-standard IRQ for your COM port.  You can get the
"DOOMODEM.ZIP" utility to fix this.  (see Chapter [14-2])
        DOOM seems to be very picky about certain kinds of modems and the
initialization strings you use with them.  Here is a list of initialization
strings that seem to work well.  Many modems have more than one in this
list; if one does not work, try another one.  Place these initialization
strings in the first line(s) of your MODEM.CFG file.

*18-4*: Why is my network slowing down when using DOOM?
=======================================================
        You may have an older version of DOOM, such as v1.0 or v1.1.  These
older versions utilized broadcast packets, which slow down many networks.
Upgrading to v1.2 will fix this problem, since v1.2 utilizes direct
packets.

*18-5*: Why won't the v1.2 patch install correctly?
===================================================
        The DOOM v1.2 patch expects to find the ORIGINAL game in your DOOM
directory.  If you replaced or altered the DOOM.EXE file with a new
version, the patch will not work.
        If you are using the shareware version, you may have an older
release of v1.1.  (there were two v1.1s)  It is recommended that you
download the full v1.2 again.
        If you are using the registered version, some distributors shipped
an older release of v1.1.  It is recommended that you call your
distributor, or E-mail "help@idsoftware.com" if you ordered from id
Software for more help.

[18-6]: DOOM is too easy
========================
        If you find DOOM too easy, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on a harder difficulty level.
        (2) Only save your game at the beginning of each level.
        (3) Never save your game and try completing the mission.
        (4) Only use your fist and pistol for the entire game.
        (5) Turn down your screen contrast so you can see less.

[18-7]: DOOM is too hard
========================
        If you find DOOM too hard, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on an easier difficulty level.
        (2) Save your game often.
        (3) Try using some of the cheat codes or a cheating utility.
        (4) Turn up your screen contrast so you can see more.
        (5) Press F11 during game play for gamma correction.

[18-8]: I get motion sickness when playing DOOM
===============================================
        There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon.  In short
some people experience dizziness attributed to the game movement.  There were
many theories, most along the line of motion sickness.  Some also said that
the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into believing it to be
real.  Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like being sea sick.
Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration (like on-off high
speed) attribute to the nausea.  I will not go into discussion of why.
Instead, I will post some steps people suggested.  Remedies are not
guaranteed to work.  There are many, all are experimental and some will have
opposite effects on different people.  This, it seems, is a very individual
problem.

        (1) Try different display sizes.  Either use different size monitors
or use the screen size option to vary the display window.

        (2) Try sitting closer/further from the display (don't stick your
nose in it, I don't want you to get radiation sick).  Try combining this with
focusing/defocusing on the display or surroundings.  This is to see if you
are being aware that you are looking at the monitor and hopefully it may
convince your brain that what you play is not really real.

        (3) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try
playing with it on/off.

        (4) Try different input devices.  With a mouse you can control
acceleration more accurately than with a joystick or the keyboard.

        (5) Play on your friend's/colleague's computer. See if it is
better/worse.

        (6) Have breaks while you play.  Play in turns.  Watch others play &
then play yourself.

        (7) If you have Sound Blaster try playing with/without the sound. If
your sound card is stereo try playing with headphones on.   Reverse the
headphones so that left becomes right.

        After switching machines, many have problems adjusting too.
On a 486, things may seem "too smooth."  On a 386, it may make you want to
vomit.  Sometimes you just have to give time to adjust.
