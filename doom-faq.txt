CHAPTER [1]: Introduction
-------------------------

*1-1*: About the "Official" DOOM FAQ
====================================        
        Well, here it is, pre-release v2.6 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.
What does that mean? Pre-release is before the game is released, version 2.6
is a standard revision written after 2.0, "Official" means absolutely
nothing, DOOM is the name of the game, and FAQs are [F]requently 
[A]sked [Q]uestions.
        Here's how revision classification works.  If a new version of        
the FAQ only has a small amount of information changed or added, the
version number is increased by 0.1.  This is called a "minor
revision."  If a new version of the FAQ has a substantial amount
of new information changed or added, the version number is increased
by 0.5.  This is called a "standard revision."  If a new version of the 
FAQ has a huge amount of added or changed information, major parts of the 
FAQ are rearranged, or major parts of the FAQ are rewritten, then the 
version number is increased by 1.0.  This is called a "major revision."
        You may be wondering why chapter numbers are enclosed in
either []'s, ()'s, or **'s.  The definition of these is as follows:

        []:  Chapters enclosed in brackets mean that the information
             contained in the chapter has not been updated in this
             or the previous FAQ.
        ():  Chapters enclosed in parenthesis mean that the information
             contained in the chapter has not been updated since the
             previous FAQ.
        **:  Chapters enclosed in asterixes means that the information
             contained in the chapter is new or has been updated for
             the current version of the FAQ you are reading.

        Version 2.6 of the FAQ adds some new information about what
DOOM will and will not support, some information about multi-player
mode, some information about DOOM's music, some information
on related software to DOOM, and some new additions to DOOM iNsAnItY.  The
"Official" DOOM FAQ v1.0 was only created from the DOOM press release and
Usenet "hearsay."  After v1.0 was released, id contacted me, and
offered to help with new releases.  So, here's another.  This may or may not
be the last "Official" DOOM FAQ before the game is released, I'm not sure.  
I guess it just depends on how quickly new information arrives.
        Well, I hope you enjoy this, it's supposed to hold you over
until the actual game release. :)
        Since nobody will probably read this part of the FAQ, if you're
reading this, just consider yourself special.  You now know about
the craziest document of all about DOOM, which will be released in
early December.  What is this document?  NO ONE KNOWS.

[1-2]: Getting the "Official" DOOM FAQ
======================================
        If you'd like, you can contact me via E-mail to get on the
"Official" DOOM FAQ mailing list.  After contacting me, you
will then be automatically sent the "Official" DOOM FAQ at every new
release via E-mail.  My Internet E-mail address is 
"ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu."  Please make the subject of your E-mail 
"DOOM Mailing List."        
        You may also just send E-mail requesting the FAQ.  Please
make the subject of the E-mail "DOOM FAQ Request."

        The "Official" DOOM FAQ is posted every two weeks (or earlier 
if a new version is released) on the following Usenet groups.
        
        (1) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action
        (2) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.announce
        (3) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc
        
        The "Subject:" line of the post will be "'Official' DOOM FAQ v??.??" 
where "??.??" is the version number of the FAQ.

        The "Official" DOOM FAQ is uploaded every two weeks (or earlier
        if a new version is released) on the following FTP sites.

        (1) ftp.uwp.edu         IN DIRECTORY    /pub/incoming/id
                                IN DIRECTORY    /pub/msdos/games/id
        (2) wuarchive.wustl.edu IN DIRECTORY    /pub/msdos_uploads/games

        The file name of the upload will be "doom??.faq" where "??" is the
version number of the FAQ.

(1-3): Adding to the FAQ

        If you want something added to the FAQ, please send E-mail to 
"ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu" (no quotes), explaining what your addition is.  
It will be reviewed, and if accepted, added to the next FAQ version, 
giving minor credit to you.  In the E-mail, please supply your name 
and E-mail address.

[1-4]: Acknowledgments
======================
        I'd like to thank id Software for becoming involved with their
on-line users and with me and this FAQ.  They have been a big help,
and without their game, this FAQ could not exist!
        I'd like to thank all the on-line users featured in "DOOM iNsAnItY"
for allowing me to use their hilarious posts in the FAQ.
        I'd like to thank all the other game companies making DOOM
look-a-likes, for helping us wait it out. :)
        I'd like to thank the following on-line users for the
following reasons:

harrop@telecom.jorn.gov.au (Mark Harrop)
        - Idea on using [], (), and ** to highlight new information
datta@cs.uwp.edu (David Datta)
        - Help with the third revised copyright notice
help@idsoftware.com (John Romero)
        - For putting up with me!  (wait, I gotta put up with him too!) :)
help@idsoftware.com (Jay Wilbur)
        - His great online attention to the consumers
help@idsoftware.com (David Taylor)
        - Calling it to my attention who he is!

        Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who reads this FAQ, you 
are what the FAQ is for!

*1-5*: Accurate Information and Game Feature Removal
====================================================
        An attempt has been made to make the information in this FAQ as
accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the game
has not been released yet, and that id is still making major changes
to the game format make it very hard to keep the FAQ as updated as possible.
        Id Software and I want to give as much accurate information to the 
public as possible pertaining to DOOM.  Flexibility and deadlines are
also some of id Software's top priorities.  Because of this, it becomes
very difficult to keep from making major changes to the game layout. 
Id Software does not want to break any game promises, but "if something
[they] said they would put into the game causes it to slow down, it gets
pulled."  Lastly, just keep in mind that anything and everything is  
subject to change, and that by the time you read this, the information
may not be perfect.
        Any and all features that were cut from DOOM have 
proven unfeasible, even on high-end systems, and made NO DIFFERENCE 
in the design and overall scheme of this game.  The original press release 
dated from January 1993 listed a few things that aren't going to be in the 
final game.  Some of those things were impossible to do after rewriting the 
3-D engine 4 times over (for speed and size); other things just made no 
sense with the rest of the design.  Trust id Software.  They know what they 
are doing.  You're gonna love DOOM!

--------------------------
CHAPTER [2]: What is DOOM?
--------------------------

        DOOM is a three dimensional, virtual reality type action game
created by id Software.  In some ways, it is similar to Wolfenstein 3-D 
(id Software, Apogee).
        In DOOM, you are a space marine suddenly flung into Hell!
Scientists stationed at a moon base constructed for investigate a
mysterious anomaly have discovered more than they bargained for!
Suddenly, waves of grotesque demons race through the base.  By the time
you hear the alarm, it is already too late.  Everyone else on the base is
dead or transformed into insane mutants.  Cock your pistol (or one of
your other 8 weapons) and prepare to meet the enemy.  You must break
through ... or DIE!

----------------------------------
CHAPTER *3*: Who is creating DOOM?
----------------------------------

        DOOM was created by id Software, and will also be published by
id Software.
        Id Software is made up of the following dedicated people:

        - John Romero     Coder         -
        - John Carmack    Coder         - 
        - Dave Taylor     Coder         -
        - Adrian Carmack  Artist        -
        - Kevin Cloud     Artist        -
        - Jay Wilbur      CEO           -
        - Sandy Peterson  Designer      -
        - Shawn Green     Tech Support  -
        - Maurice Hale    Tech Support  -
        - Robert Prince   Music         -

Note: Apogee has NOTHING to do with DOOM.

----------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]: When is the release date of DOOM?
----------------------------------------------

        DOOM was first said to be released in "the third quarter of 1993."
id Software has now delayed the release date until December 10th, 1993.
They said that they needed to delay the release to ensure a quality product.
Also, they said part of the delay has been caused by putting the DOOM work 
aside while they worked on a Super Nintendo version of Wolfenstein 3-D.

-------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [5]: Where can I get DOOM and related software?
-------------------------------------------------------

*5-1*: Where can I get DOOM?
============================
        DOOM will be available via anonymous FTP on id's official
FTP site, "ftp.uwp.edu", in the /pub/msdos/games/id directory. 
        DOOM will also be available on 25 other FTP sites to be
distributed by the FTP operator of "ftp.uwp.edu".  When DOOM is
released, please choose the nearest FTP site to you and receive
DOOM from that site.  The list of the 25 FTP sites has not been
released yet, but will be released in the near future.
        DOOM will be available via the Software Creations BBS.
The phone number of Software Creations is (508)-368-7036.
        Lastly, the shareware of DOOM will be available from id Software for 
a minimal shipping and handling charge.  The mail-order version will
also be available, for $40 and a shipping and handling charge.  Id 
Software's phone number is (800)-ID-GAMES in the USA, 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week.  Next-Day-Air is available, as are other shipping methods,
so as to "shorten the delay of the demise of numerous demons."
        Customers not in the USA will be directed to call licensed id
Software distributors to order DOOM.  The complete list of international
distributors will be in the game.
        DOOM will only be available after December 10th, 1993, and
pre-ordering or reserving copies is NOT permitted.

[5-2]: Where can I get related DOOM hints?
==========================================
        Shortly after release, the Official DOOM Hint Book and Hint Disk
will be available, price to be announced.

(5-3): Where can I get DOOM screen shots?
=========================================
        Id Software's OFFICIAL DOOM screen shots are available at the same 
FTP site (ftp.uwp.edu) and directory (/pub/msdos/games/id).  The screen 
shot file names are as follows:

        (1) doompix1.exe (a self-extracting archive)
        (2) doom01.zip
        (3) doom02.zip
        (4) doom03.zip
        (5) doom04.zip
        (6) doomscn5.zip

        UNOFFICIAL screen shots (screen shots made by users and not
approved by id Software) are also available.  Currently, they are
available on "ftp.uwp.edu" in directory "/pub/incoming/id".  Soon 
the screen shots will most likely be moved to 
"/pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew/doom".  The UNOFFICIAL screen shot
file names are as follows:

        (1) undmscn.zip
        (2) doomus.zip

Note:  In NO WAY are these screen shots endorsed by id Software
or by Hank Leukart.  Any damages or problems you may have with these
screen shots are not the responsibility of id Software or Hank Leukart.

        Additionally, there is a Windows demonstration of DOOM created
by Doug Marien.  This demo incorporates many of the best DOOM screen 
shots, a humorous sound sample, and the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  At the time 
of the release of v2.6 of the FAQ, the newest version of this demo 
was v1.4, and it incorporates v2.0 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  This demo is 
available under the name "dmslug14.zip" via FTP in the "/pub/incoming/id" 
directory on "ftp.uwp.edu".  If the demo is not in that directory, it was 
probably moved to the "pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew/doom" directory.
        Version 2.0 of this demo will be released soon.  This demo
will include v2.5 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ as well as a by-chapter
information search feature.  Additional new sounds and music will
be added, as well as some new screen shots.

(5-4): Where can I get a working demo of DOOM?
==============================================
        Currently, there is NO working demo of DOOM.  However, there are
screen shots of DOOM. (see Chapter [5-3]) The FIRST known release of DOOM 
is explained in Chapter [5-1].

Note: Unless you are an official id Software Beta-Tester, any Beta
version that you may have in your posession is a violation of U.S.
federal copyright laws.  Violation of these laws can result in fines
of up to $250,000 and jail terms of up to 5 years.  If you are in
posession of a Beta version, it is suggested that you delete your
copy immediately.

---------------------------                              
CHAPTER [6]: DOOM Marketing
--------------------------- 

[6-1]: How will DOOM be marketed?
=================================
        The first episode of DOOM will be shareware (8 levels + secret),
and will be available to the general public.  As with all of id Software's
games, the shareware version of DOOM will have NO registration fee.  Two 
additional episodes will be available immediately after release, which 
feature a "journey to another dimension."  These additional episodes will 
sold by mail order from id Software.
        A commercial episode will be released sometime in 1994.

[6-2]: How much will DOOM cost?
===============================
        The mail-order version of DOOM will cost $40.00 (US Currency) plus
a minimal shipping and handling charge.
        The commercial episode's price has not been set as yet.

------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [7]: What will I need to run DOOM?
------------------------------------------

(7-1): What is REQUIRED to run DOOM?
====================================
        DOOM will require a 386sx IBM compatible computer running DOS, VGA 
(320x200x256) graphics, and 4mb of RAM.
        DOOM will also be ported to the Atari Jaguar.  No other ports
are planned at this time that id Software "can talk about."
        The shareware episode of DOOM MAY EXCEED 1.44mb in compressed form,
and the "commercial" episodes (together) will be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 10mb, uncompressed.

(7-2): What soundcards will DOOM support?
========================================
        DOOM will support the Adlib, SoundBlaster, SoundBlaster Pro, 
SoundBlaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas, and the Pro Audio Spectrum (in 
native mode).
        DOOM supports MPU-401 uarts which are what most General MIDI
cards use.  This includes Creative Labs' Waveblaster.

(7-2-1): Will DOOM support the Gravis UltraSound?
-------------------------------------------------
        You will be happy to know that id is working hand-in-hand with
both Gravis and Forte to make sure the game supports the GUS in native
mode.  "If it can be done, we will do it!" says Jay Wilbur of id
Software. (jay@idsoftware.com)
        Jay Wilbur speaks on the topic of GUS 3D support:        
        
        "Size limitations for the shareware version and new technology
on the horizon (for newer, cooler games) are the reasons we may not put
the GUS 3D support in.  The amount of sounds it requires would eat too
much disk space for us to handle.  Listen, we want to support the GUS
as much as you want us to support the GUS.
        Our sound code guy has committed to getting the board up and
running.  Gravis and Forte have provided resources beyond the call of
duty to help us get the board up and running.  We want to get the
board up and running.
        The fact remains that something outside our control (code size,
our inexperience with the board and deadlines, etc.) may (possibly,
perhaps, unlikely but maybe) prevent us from providing native support.
If that happens, nobody will be sadder than us.  We will miss bundling
opportunities with Gravis, sales opportunities with GUS users, etc.
This is not a pleasant thought for us.
        Please try to understand our position.  We want to support the GUS
as much, perhaps even more, than you do.  We will do everything in our
power to put the support in.  If everything works out (and it looks like
it will--the game is running with native GUS support in right now) the
code will be in.  If the code is not in, please don't come and try to kill
us, we did everything we could to make it happen."

(7-3): What game controllers will DOOM support?
==============================================
        DOOM will support keyboard, mouses (plural of "mouse" when talking
about computers, believe me), joysticks, and trackballs (functioning
as a mouse).
        DOOM will also support the Gravis Gamepad.

(7-3-1): Will DOOM support the Logitech Cyberman?
-------------------------------------------------
        As of now, it seems that DOOM will *NOT* support the
Cyberman.  Id Software does not feel it is the best controller
for DOOM.

------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [8]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
------------------------------------------------------------

        Parts of this list of DOOM's features were taken from the
January 1, 1993 and August 24, 1993 DOOM press releases.

[8-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC. 
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and
scanned textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an
environment, makes the world much more real, thus bringing the
player more into the game experience.  Others have attempted
this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate, and
seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big
improvement over Wolfenstein 3-D.  With their new advanced graphic
development techniques, allowing game art to be generated five
times faster, id brings new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[8-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined 
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's 
walls can be at any angle, and be of any thickness.  Walls can have 
see-through areas, change shape, and animate.  This allows more natural
construction of levels.  If you can draw it on paper, you can
see it in the game.

[8-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With
distance, your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This
makes areas seem huge and intensifies the experience.  This may also
require you to search for a light switch!  Light sourcing allows lamps 
and lights to illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe 
lights to briefly reveal things near them.  These two features will make 
the game frighteningly real.

*8-4*: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs,
poles, altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great
variety for rooms and halls.
        In the final version of DOOM, you WILL be able to shoot monsters
that are higher or lower than you are.  All you have to do is aim
laterally, and DOOM will do the rest!

[8-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces can animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it.
Radioactive ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment
animation and morphing.  Id Software has removed information terminals, 
access stations, and wall weapon damaging.  Additionally, rooms will no 
longer close in on you, and walls will not have animated messages.  See
Chapter [1-5] for more information on features removed from DOOM.

[8-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been 
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors) and invincibility mode.  See Chapter [1-5] for more
information on features that are removed from DOOM.

[8-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  You can see the other player
in the environment, communicate with him or her, and in certain situations
you can switch to their view.  This feature, added to the 3-D realism, makes 
DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its release a landmark
event in the software industry.
        This is the first game to really exploit the power of LANs and
modems to their full potential.  In 1994, we fully expect to be
the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses
around the world.
        See Chapter 9 for more information on multi-playing.

[8-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the
development end to provide the smoothest control on the user
end.  And the frame rate (the rate at which the screen is
updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to room,
turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky
motion of most 3-D games.  On a 386sx, the game runs well, and
on a 486/33, the normal mode frame rate is faster than movies or
television.  This allows for the most important and enjoyable
aspect of gameplay-immersion.
        Recently, id began optimizing DOOM to run best on 486 and Pentium
systems.  Because of this, DOOM won't run as beautifully on a 386 as
first thought.  However, id is thinking of keeping 386-optimized code
in the game as a selectable option.  Another id idea is developing an
alternate set of levels that will optimize performance on 386 systems,
but the actual code wouldn't change.
        According to id, 386's SHOULD be able to get a decent frame
rate while playing DOOM by using Medium Detail and sizing the screen
down a notch or two.
        Lastly, id is "looking into" adding a VESA SVGA page-flip mode
that will be "mostly-compatible with a lot of" SVGA board and will
speed up performance.  This would not be the default mode, and would NOT
work on ALL systems.

[8-9]: Monster Artificial Intelligence
======================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed
rooms.  When you open a door, the guards get a chance to
see you and opening the door connects your sound area to
the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will be heard
in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this
kind of action.
        In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a
bunch of rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast
your shotgun and the sound could travel through a window
or slime-river tunnel to another entirely different area
and piss-off some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking
for you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through
slime, etc.  You'll still be able to get the drop on them
from behind, just like in Wolfenstein 3-D -- but you have to be
sneakier about it.

[8-10]: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that will be included in DOOM.  Don't
try using these at home. :)

        (1) Fist
        (2) Chain Saw
        (3) Pistol
        (4) Shotgun
        (5) Chain Gun
        (6) Missile Launcher
        (7) Plasma Gun
        (8) BFG9000

---------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER (9): How will 2-4 player action work in DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------
        DOOM will support 2-4 players in a multi-player mode.
DOOM will be playable over networks, modems and by serial link.
The shareware version of DOOM *will* support multi-players.

(9-1): What will the multi-player gameplay be like?
===================================================
        In DOOM, players will be able to see each other, and watch
each other jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players
will be able to watch others get hurt, die, and move throughout
the labyrinth.  DOOM will allow players to play together, working as 
a team.  In this cooperative mode, players can see each other on an
"automap" and switch to each other's view.

*9-1-1*: How will players communicate?
--------------------------------------                
        Players can communicate in real-time messages while playing 
DOOM.  Game play will not stop while a player sends a message.  To send
a message, you would type a "chat-mode activator key," then the
destination (or you can specify to send to all players).  You can then
enter your message, hit enter, and the message is sent.
        When starting DOOM on a network or by modem, the computer
will give you a message saying, "You Are Player 1." (or whatever
player you are)  Then, you can contact people in chat-mode by
player number.

(9-1-2): Can players exchange supplies?
---------------------------------------
        As of now, players will not be able to exchange supplies
during the game.  Supplies includes ammo, weapons, or health.  However,
when you pickup a weapon, it does not disappear from the "playing
field."  Other players may still take the same weapon.  Weapons
can be taken indefinately.

(9-1-3): What happens when a player dies?
-----------------------------------------
        As of now, nothing happens.  The player just dies.  His supplies
cannot be taken by other players.  However, when you pickup a weapon, it 
does not disappear from the "playing field."  Other players may still
take the same weapon.  Weapons can be taken indefinately.

(9-2): What exactly is "DeathMatch" mode?
=========================================
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level will be infested with enemies 
and power-ups.  Everyone must kill all the demons to ready the battlefield 
for the player vs. player manhunt (my favorite gaming word).  In this mode, 
players will not be able to see the other players in the automap, nor 
switch to their view.  Players will not be able to view other's health 
in the mode, because of the disadvantage this can cause.

(9-3): How will DOOM work with networks?
========================================
        DOOM will support the IPX (Novell Netware) protocol in the initial 
shareware version.  Any network supporting the protocol should work fine.
TCP/IP and other protocols will be supported in a later version
soon after DOOM's release.  Using this network support, DOOM could be
played in a workplace type environment.
        
(9-4): How will DOOM work with modems?
======================================
        DOOM will work in two player mode by modem or serial
link.  The minimum baud rate to play DOOM will be 9600 bps.  There
is no maximum baud rate, except for hardware/phone line limitations.

(9-5): Can I play DOOM over the Internet?
=========================================
        With Internet access, a 56K line, and only a few router hops,
you should be able to run DOOM over the InterNet.  An Internet server is 
being planned to handle many DOOM players at once, but this is not a 
definite, and cannot be designed until the release of DOOM.  "I'll get to 
work on it as soon as the game comes out =)", says Saqib A. Qureshi. 
(qureshi@ug.cs.dal.ca)

---------------------------------------------
CHAPTER (10): What will DOOM's music be like?
---------------------------------------------
        
        Many people have been requesting that specific songs be
added to DOOM.  DOOM's music will be ALL original and composed
by Robert Prince.  However, his tunes may have traces of Alice In Chains,
Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, and other similar groups.  There
will be "lots of excellent suspense music" as well.

--------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [11]: How can I contact id Software?
--------------------------------------------

        Id Software can be contacted via the InterNet.  If you would like to
ask any questions about DOOM (that are not answered in here), send
E-mail to help@idsoftware.com.        
        Id Software can also be reached at their 800 number.  The
number is (800)-ID-GAMES.  This number is for ordering games ONLY.  This
number is not for technical support or inquires.

CHAPTER (12): DOOM iNsAnItY
---------------------------

        This chapter features humor about DOOM, written by ANYONE who's  
willing to try (or maybe even on accident).  Anyway, here they are.

(12-1): Comedy
==============

        This is the chapter of DOOM iNsAnItY where free-form comedy
is written.

[12-1-1]: A word from Douglas J. Bottoms
----------------------------------------
        FOREWORD:  Here's the first addition to DOOM iNsAnItY!
This was posted on comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Thursday,
October 21, 1993.  He speaks on a new game idea: id programmers
as bad guys in DOOM.

----------
Subject: NEW GAME!  id programmers as bad guys in DOOM!
From: Douglas J. Bottoms <DBottoms@Lilly.Com>
Date: Thu Oct 21 10:00:02 1993

That's it!!  I new twist on the game!!!  The DOOM good guys are idle
gaming buffs who have finally cracked and can no longer wait for the
release of the only game that will make ALL OTHER games seem like PONG!
Blind Wolfenstein will no longer simmer the anger!  They go slap-happy and
grab their multidimensional boots and gloves (with snazzy smooth shading)
and go to the id programmers' dungeon/lair.  It will be a slaughter!
Pixilated programmers, peeved project leaders, panting personnel...the
works.  The big bosses could be just that, the big bosses, especially the
one who just made a press release that DOOM would be delayed another few
months (this is make believe, of course - (squint) you aren't going to
delay the release (pant, pant);  look into my eyes  (o)(o) (imagine
reversing sound) and repeat after me, "I must release DOOM soon.  I must
program, eat, sleep day and night."  Mu who ha ha ha!).

Excuse my sanity.  I get a bit zany when I get thinking about the soon to
be released game that will resolve the U.S.' Deficit and save the rats
from being beheaded on the space shuttle.  I see the sun raising...

The thoughts expressed here are entirely my own and do not necessarily
reflect the thoughts of any other individual or group affiliated with Eli
Lilly and Company.

*12-1-2*: DOOM: The Real Thing
------------------------------
        FOREWORD: This messages was posted from gills@qucdn.queensu.ca on 
Usenet in the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Monday,
November 15, 1993.  He has a new idea: playing DOOM in REAL LIFE!

----------
Howdy,

        Yes, like all you DOOM fans I have been eagerly awaiting the release 
date for this landmark game.  Although I was very disappointed in the 
release date being bumped up from 3rd quarter '93 to Dec 10, I limited my 
anger and frustration to strangling my neighbour's cat (didn't like it much
anyways....   ;)   ).

        But, NOW I'm forced to read all the great stuff about the Beta 
release that some people have been lucky enough to get their hands on.
....well, not FORCED to read it, but I can't help absorbing every bit of 
information I can possibly locate.   :)

        I can't handle the fact that some people have tried the game now, 
and I haven't, so I thought I might pull out my brass knuckles and 12 gauge 
pump shotgun and start up a *REAL* DOOM game. I figured that I, and 3 other
frustrated DOOM awaiters, could meet up at an abandoned warehouse or
something and have a rip snortin' Death Match of our own.  We could throw
some shotgun shells and ammo boxes randomly around the place, along with
some first-aid kits (fine for light grazes from perhaps a .22 calibre round
but not much good for a 12 gauge belly wound  :)  ) - then we go at it !!!

        Granted, there won't be any monsters in this place, like there are 
in DOOM, but I do have a pretty ugly cousin I could trick into coming; and 
with a quick dunk in some gray paint I'm convinced he could bear a passable
resemblance to a gargoyle <G>.

So ....any takers?    Heh, heh, heh.

Note: This a JOKE, only a joke....that's J-O-K-E..as in, I'm not serious.
      If you are a certified nut-bar who would like to really try this out
      don't bother calling me up....I get faint from tension just playing
      Paintball   :)

        But, seriously...I CAN wait until Dec 10 to play DOOM but it's 
getting pretty tense doing the waiting game.  I guess in the mean time I can 
go pick up some Depends (adult diapers) and some I.V. supplies so I'll be 
prepared on Dec 10 to stay on the computer playing DOOM steadily until I 
collapse from exhaustion.
        Of course if a copy of Beta-DOOM *DID* happen to make it's way to 
me, I would still download the shareware version and register/pay for the 
full release.
I swear I would....really...I promise....scout's honor...anyone?..anyone?

OK, so sue me, I had to ask.       :)

P.S.    If this game is good as it's suppose to be, I'm gonna name my first
        born child "ID".... IDDY?...IDarina?...IDI-Sue?....

*12-1-3*: Beta-Tester's Joystick Sliced Off While Sleeping at Computer!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        FOREWORD:  I received this piece of hilarious E-mail from
John Romero.  This was written by Douglas Howell (one of the DOOM
Beta-testers) when id decided to axe the entire Beta-tester list and start 
from scratch.  Douglas Howell will be reinstated as a Beta-tester, as
soon as his "joystick" heals. :)  Let the Bobbitt saga continue!

----------
NEWSFLASH:  Beta tester's joystick sliced off while sleeping
            at computer!

At a news conference today, a beta tester of software said that he had
fallen asleep while testing a game for id Software, developers of the
best-seliing game Wolfenstein 3D.  Awaking in the middle of the night,
he looked down and to his horror discovered that three-fourths of his
joystick had been sliced cleanly off.  When questioned, id Software
admitted to doing the deed and charged that the beta tester was a
two-timer.  Id spokesman Shawn Green stated-- "What was done had to be
done.  Id was definitely not satisfied by this guy's performance. All he
cared about was taking software and sticking it into other people's hard
drives!".

The severed joystick was later found by police on a street corner.
Apparently id had fled the scene with the sliced piece still in hand and
tossed it out a car window.  Surgeons have since sewn the stick back on,
but it seems to malfunction whenever playing id's beta software.
Doctors predict that the joystick should perform normally again by
December 10th.
----------

(12-2): Top Ten Lists
=====================
        Here, humorous top ten lists regarding DOOM are written.

[12-2-1]: Top Ten Things to Do While Waiting for DOOM
-----------------------------------------------------
        FOREWORD:  This was posted on Amercia Online, by someone
using the name "Wolkonsky" on August 27, 1993.

----------
        Well, here we are waiting another 2-3 months [for DOOM].  What else 
can we do? 

1) Search the Internet for Beta Version.
2) See if we can go through Wolfenstein 3-D with our eyes closed.
3) Use MapEdit/WolfEdit to make Wolfenstein 3-D "look like" DOOM.
4) Find out where the id "lab" is and "encourage" them.
5) Watch the new 90210 episode!
6) See if Blake Stone or Rampage will be any good.
7) Upload the Lemmings Demo as "DOOM10.ZIP" and see what happens.
8) Get girlfriends and drop them on 12/10/93, unless they like DOOM and
   have a computer with a modem.
9) Or lastly, look at DOOM slides and "pretend" we are playing.
----------

(12-2-2): Top Ten Things To Do Until DOOM Arrives
-------------------------------------------------
        FOREWORD:  This was posted on Amercia Online, by someone
using the name "ScottBro" on October 7, 1993.
                         
----------
                          Top  10  Things  To Do
                           Until  DOOM  arrives

10.  Get a marker and change boxes of George Lucas's "LOOM" to "DOOM" to
     confuse over-anxious gamers.
9.   Issue bogus press release from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist,
     saying the DOOMsday clock will strike midnight sometime before
     September 30, 1993.
8.   Get a date with someone from L7.
7.   When feeling depressed due to the wait, chant the B.J. Blaskowitz mantra,
     "This is my rifle, This is my gun,
      This is for killing, this is for fun.
6.   Memorize the July Computer Gaming World, pages 104-5, preview of DOOM.
5.   Get network and sound card installed on all systems at the office.
4.   Make DOOM acronyms, like
     "Dantes Obsessive Outrageous Marauders"
3.   Tell boss I'll need two weeks vacation on very short notice during the
     third quarter, due to pending family crisis.
2.   Figure a way to persuade Id to allow imports of faces on monsters, so
     we can make creatures like the:
     Sunnunu Bloated Beast, the Michael Bolton Shrieker, and the Ex-Wife
     from Hell, where she belongs.
1.   Try and make friends with the Big Blue guys from Wolfie;
     We might need help this time.

----------
        The DOOM Delay of `93 might be worse than we first thought! Here is 
a list of things that I heard were being taken out of DOOM.

1) Socks the Cat
2) Cameo by the Mario Brothers (you thought the Pac-Man Ghosts were bad)

(12-3): DOOM R.E.M.
===================
        David Reeve Sward suggested that I add a section in the FAQ
for people who have been dreaming about DOOM while sleeping.  I told him
it was crazy until three people posted messages about having "DOOM Dreams."
Here they are, pixelated and all!

(12-3-1): Pixelated Demons 
--------------------------
        FOREWORD: This dream was posted by David Reeve Sward on Usenet in 
the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Tuesday, November 2, 1993.

----------
A few days ago I awoke in the middle of a dream about DOOM...!  I was
firing the shotgun at a pixelated (yes, my dream was pixelated) demon
when my alarm clock went off (well, it turned the radio on :).  Haven't
seen any alpha or beta version, only the screen shots.  Time to schedule
an appointment with a local shrink...

I can't imagine what shape I'll be in once the game is actually released :).
----------

(12-3-2): The Mythical Beta Releases
------------------------------------
        FOREWORD: This dream was posted by Christopher Johnson on Usenet in 
the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Tuesday, November 2, 1993.

----------
Strange enough, I had a dream about DOOM last evening, too.  I dreamt that I
had found the mythical beta release version lying around on a FTP site,
downloaded it, and actually got to play it before anyone else.  Now, I know
I could just do this anyways, but I have too many morals.
What are you doing to us, Jay, now we're DREAMING about getting 
DOOM... SIGH..
---------

(12-3-3): You Don't Take Mastercard?!
-------------------------------------
        FOREWORD: This dream was posted from szwells@hamlet.ucdavis.edu 
on Usenet in the group comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Tuesday, 
November 2, 1993.

----------        
        While you all were dreaming, I was having some serious nightmares.
DOOM was released early and I went down to buy it ASAP.  When I opened my 
wallet, it was empty.  And they wouldn't accept credit or personal checks...  
I spent the rest of the night trying to scrounge up the cash to buy it.  
It was not a pretty sight!
----------

------------------------
CHAPTER [13]: Conclusion
------------------------

        Well, there's v2.6 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ by Hank Leukart.  
Hopefully, this version of the FAQ should have been more informative than 
the first version, since id got involved, and started helping out.  Keep
up the good work, id!  The FAQ will become MUCH more complicated after
the game is released.  There will be more chapters, and they will
have many more sub chapters.  If you know things that I don't feel free 
to suggest them via E-mail to "ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu".

[13-1]: John Says...
====================
        I just thought I'd throw this in to get everyone EVEN MORE excited
about DOOM!
        John Romero's latest words on DOOM are as follows:

        "DOOM's [screen] refresh [rate] has been getting faster and
faster.  This game definitely COOKS and looks totally AWESOME.
Wolfenstein 3-D now looks like a cartoon."

CHAPTER [14]: Revision History
------------------------------

[14-1]: Pre-Game-Release FAQs
=============================

v1.0:  First release of the DOOM FAQ.  (October 25, 1993)

v1.0a: When ASCII uploading v1.0, the spacing malfunctioned.  This is
       the same version as 1.0, except with fixed spacing. (October 25, 1993)

v2.0:  First major revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  Id gets involved, 
       giving new information.  The FAQ is rearranged.  The FAQ is renamed
       from "The DOOM FAQ" to the "The 'Official' DOOM FAQ." (November 1, 
       1993)

v2.5:  A standard revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  More information 
       comes in on what DOOM will and won't support.  More DOOM iNsAnItY is 
       added. Information on related DOOM software is added.  Information on
       DOOM's music and multi-playing is added.  Sorry!  The "Official" 
       DOOM FAQ is no longer 666 lines. :)  (November 13, 1993)

v2.6:  A minor revision of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  Grammatic and spelling
       errors are corrected.  The use of asterixes, parenthesis, and
       brackets are used to highlight which information is new to a FAQ.
       Two new additions to DOOM iNsAnItY that didn't quite make it
       to the v2.5 release are added.  More multi-playing information
       added.  (November 17, 1993)

[14-2]: Post-Game-Release FAQs
==============================

        To be added soon. (I hope!)
