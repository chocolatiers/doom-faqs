CHAPTER 1: Introduction
-----------------------

[1-1]: About the "Official" DOOM FAQ
====================================        
        Well, here it is, pre-release v2.0 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.
What does that mean? Pre-release is before the game is released, version 2.0
is a major revision written after 1.0, "Official" means absolutely
nothing, DOOM is the name of the game, and FAQs are [F]requently 
[A]sked [Q]uestions.
        Version 2.0 of the FAQ adds a lot of updated information.  This
is because FAQ v1.0 was only created from the DOOM press release and
Usenet "hearsay."  After v1.0 was released, id contacted me, and
offered to help with new releases.  So, here it is.  This may or may not
be the last "Official" DOOM FAQ before the game is released, I'm not sure.  
I guess it just depends on how quickly new information arrives.
        Well, I hope you enjoy this, it's supposed to hold you over
until the actual game release. :)

[1-2]: Getting the "Official" DOOM FAQ
======================================
        If you'd like, you can contact me via E-mail to get on the
"Official" DOOM FAQ mailing list.  After contacting me, you
will then be automatically sent the "Official" DOOM FAQ at every new
release via E-mail.  My InterNet E-mail address is "ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu."
Please make the subject of your E-mail "DOOM mailing list."        

        The "Official" DOOM FAQ is posted every two weeks (or earlier 
if a new version is released) on the following Usenet groups.
        
        (1) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action
        (2) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.announce
        (3) comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc
        
        The "Subject:" line of the post will be "'Official' DOOM FAQ v??.??" 
where "??.??" is the version number of the FAQ.

        The "Official" DOOM FAQ is uploaded every two weeks (or earlier
        if a new version is released) on the following FTP sites.

        (1) ftp.uwp.edu         IN DIRECTORY    /pub/incoming/id
                                IN DIRECTORY    /pub/msdos/games/id
        (2) wuarchive.wustl.edu IN DIRECTORY    /pub/msdos_uploads/games

        The file name of the upload will be "doom??.faq" where "??" is the
version number of the FAQ.

[1-3]: Acknowledgments
======================
        I'd like to thank id software for becoming involved with their
on-line users and with me and this FAQ.  They have been a big help,
and without their game, this FAQ could not exist!
        I'd like to thank all the on-line users featured in "DOOM iNsAnItY"
for allowing me to use their hilarious posts in the FAQ.
        I'd like to thank all the other game companies making DOOM
look-a-likes, for helping us wait it out. :)
        Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who reads this FAQ, you 
are what the FAQ is for!

[1-4]: Accurate Information
===========================
        An attempt has been made to make the information in this FAQ as
accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the game
has not been released yet, and that id is still making major changes
to the game format make it very hard to keep the FAQ as updated as possible.
        Id Software and I want to give as much accurate information to the 
public as possible pertaining to DOOM.  Flexibility and deadlines are
also some of id Software's top priorities.  Because of this, it becomes
very difficult to keep from making major changes to the game layout. 
Id Software does not want to break any game promises, but "if something
[they] said they would put into the game causes it to slow down, it gets
pulled."  Lastly, just keep in mind that anything and everything is  
subject to change, and that by the time you read this, the information
may not be perfect.

------------------------
CHAPTER 2: What is DOOM?
------------------------

        DOOM is a three dimensional, virtual reality type action game
created by id Software.  In some ways, it is similar to Wolfenstein 3-D 
(id Software, Apogee).
        In DOOM, you are a space marine suddenly flung into Hell!
Scientists stationed at a moon base constructed for investigate a
mysterious anomaly have discovered more than they bargained for!
Suddenly, waves of grotesque demons race through the base.  By the time
you hear the alarm, it is already too late.  Everyone else on the base is
dead or transformed into insane mutants.  Cock your pistol (or one of
your other 8 weapons) and prepare to meet the enemy.  You must break
through ... or DIE!

--------------------------------
CHAPTER 3: Who is creating DOOM?
--------------------------------

        DOOM was created by id Software, and will also be published by
id Software.

Note: Apogee has NOTHING to do with DOOM.

--------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 4: When is the release date of DOOM?
--------------------------------------------

        DOOM was first said to be released in "the third quarter of 1993."
id Software has now delayed the release date until December 10th, 1993.
They said that they needed to delay the release to ensure a quality product.
Also, they said part of the delay has been caused by putting the DOOM work 
aside while they worked on a Super Nintendo version of Wolfenstein 3-D.

-----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 5: Where can I get DOOM and related software?
-----------------------------------------------------

[5-1]: Where can I get DOOM?
============================

        DOOM will be available via anonymous FTP on id's official
FTP site, "ftp.uwp.edu", in the /pub/msdos/games/id directory. 
        DOOM will be available via the Software Creations BBS.
The phone number of Software Creations is (508)-368-7036.
        Lastly, the shareware version of DOOM will be available
from id Software for a minimal shipping and handling charge.
id Software's phone number is (800)-ID-GAMES in the USA, 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.  Next-Day-Air is available, as are other shipping methods,
so as to "shorten the delay of the demise of numerous demons."
        Customers not in the USA will be directed to call licensed id
Software distributors to order DOOM.  The complete list of international
distributors will be in the game.
        DOOM will only be available after December 10th, 1993.
        
[5-2]: Where can I get related DOOM hints?
==========================================
        Shortly after release, the Official DOOM Hint Book and Hint Disk
will be available, price to be announced.

[5-3]: Where can I get DOOM screen shots?
=========================================

        DOOM screen shots are available at the same FTP site (ftp.uwp.edu)
and directory (/pub/msdos/games/id).  The screen shot file names are 
as follows:

        (1) doom01.zip
        (2) doom02.zip
        (3) doom03.zip
        (4) doom04.zip
        (5) doomscn5.zip

[5-4]: Where can I get a working demo of DOOM?
==============================================

        Currently, there is NO working demo of DOOM.  However, there are
screen shots of DOOM. (see Chapter [5-2]) The FIRST known release of DOOM 
is explained in Chapter [5-1].

Note: ANY working demo/beta of DOOM that you have played is COMPLETELY
illegal (unless you are a beta tester).  If you own a copy, delete it
IMMEDIATELY.

-------------------------                              
CHAPTER 6: DOOM Marketing
------------------------- 

[6-1]: How will DOOM be marketed?
=================================
        The first episode of DOOM will be shareware (8 levels + secret),
and will be available to the general public.  Two additional episodes
will be available immediately after release, which feature a "journey
to another dimension."  These additional episodes will sold by mail 
order from id Software.
        A commercial episode will be released sometime in 1994.

[6-2]: How much will DOOM cost?
===============================
        The registered version of DOOM will cost $40.00 (US Currency) plus
a minimal shipping and handling charge.

----------------------------------------
CHAPTER 7: What will I need to run DOOM?
----------------------------------------

        DOOM will require a 386sx IBM compatible computer running DOS, VGA 
(320x200x256) graphics, and 2mb of RAM.  DOOM will support the Adlib, 
SoundBlaster, SoundBlaster Pro, SoundBlaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas,
and the Pro Audio Spectrum (in native mode).

        You will be happy to know that id is working hand-in-hand with
both Gravis and Forte to make sure the game supports the GUS in native
mode.  "If it can be done, we will do it!" says Jay Wilbur of id
Software. (jay@idsoftware.com)
        Jay Wilbur speaks on the topic of GUS 3D support:        
        
        "Size limitations for the shareware version and new technology
on the horizon (for newer, cooler games) are the reasons we may not put
the GUS 3D support in.  The amount of sounds it requires would eat too
much disk space for us to handle.  Listen, we want to support the GUS
as much as you want us to support the GUS.
        Our sound code guy has committed to getting the board up and
running.  Gravis and Forte have provided resources beyond the call of
duty to help us get the board up and running.  We want to get the
board up and running.
        The fact remains that something outside our control (code size,
our inexperience with the board and deadlines, etc.) may (possibly,
perhaps, unlikely but maybe) prevent us from providing native support.
If that happens, nobody will be sadder than us.  We will miss bundling
opportunities with Gravis, sales opportunities with GUS users, etc.
This is not a pleasant thought for us.
        Please try to understand our position.  We want to support the GUS
as much, perhaps even more, than you do.  We will do everything in our
power to put the support in.  If everything works out (and it looks like
it will--the game is running with native GUS support in right now) the
code will be in.  If the code is not in, please don't come and try to kill
us, we did everything we could to make it happen."

        The shareware episode of DOOM MAY EXCEED 1.44mb in compressed form,
and the "commercial" episodes (together) will be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 10mb, uncompressed.

----------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 8: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
----------------------------------------------------------

        Parts of this list of DOOM's features were taken from the
January 1, 1993 and August 24, 1993 DOOM press releases.

[8-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC. 
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and
scanned textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an
environment, makes the world much more real, thus bringing the
player more into the game experience.  Others have attempted
this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate, and
seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big
improvement over Wolfenstein.  With their new advanced graphic
development techniques, allowing game art to be generated five
times faster, id brings new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[8-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined 
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's 
walls can be at any angle, and be of any thickness.  Walls can have 
see-through areas, change shape, and animate.  This allows more natural
construction of levels.  If you can draw it on paper, you can
see it in the game.

[8-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With
distance, your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This
makes areas seem huge and intensifies the experience.  This may also
require you to search for a light switch!  Light sourcing allows lamps 
and lights to illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe 
lights to briefly reveal things near them.  These two features will make 
the game frighteningly real.

[8-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs,
poles, altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great
variety for rooms and halls.

[8-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces can animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it.
Radioactive ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment
animation and morphing.  Id Software has removed information terminals, 
access stations, and wall weapon damaging.  Additionally, rooms will no 
longer close in on you, and walls will not have animated messages.  See
Chapter [1-4] for more information on features removed from DOOM.

[8-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been 
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors) and invincibility mode.  See Chapter [1-4] for more
information on features that are removed from DOOM.

[8-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  You can see the other player
in the environment, communicate with him or her, and in certain situations
you can switch to their view.  This feature, added to the 3-D realism, makes 
DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its release a landmark
event in the software industry.
        This is the first game to really exploit the power of LANs and
modems to their full potential.  In 1993, we fully expect to be
the number one cause of decreased productivity in businesses
around the world.
        See Chapter 9 for more information on multi-playing.

[8-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the
development end to provide the smoothest control on the user
end.  And the frame rate (the rate at which the screen is
updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to room,
turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky
motion of most 3-D games.  On a 386sx, the game runs well, and
on a 486/33, the normal mode frame rate is faster than movies or
television.  This allows for the most important and enjoyable
aspect of gameplay-immersion.
        Recently, id began optimizing DOOM to run best on 486 and Pentium
systems.  Because of this, DOOM won't run as beautifully on a 386 as
first thought.  However, id is thinking of keeping 386-optimized code
in the game as a selectable option.  Another id idea is developing an
alternate set of levels that will optimize performance on 386 systems,
but the actual code wouldn't change.
        Lastly, id is "looking into" adding a VESA SVGA page-flip mode
that will be "mostly-compatible with a lot of" SVGA board and will
speed up performance.  This would not be the default mode, and would NOT
work on ALL systems.

[8-9]: Monster Artificial Intelligence
======================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed
rooms.  When you open a door, the guards get a chance to
see you and opening the door connects your sound area to
the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will be heard
in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this
kind of action.
        In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a
bunch of rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast
your shotgun and the sound could travel through a window
or slime-river tunnel to another entirely different area
and piss-off some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking
for you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through
slime, etc.  You'll still be able to get the drop on them
from behind, just like in Wolfenstein 3-D -- but you have to be
sneakier about it.

[8-10]: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that will be included in DOOM.  Don't
try using these at home. :)

        (1) Fist
        (2) Chain Saw
        (3) Pistol
        (4) Shotgun
        (5) Chain Gun
        (6) Missile Launcher
        (7) Plasma Gun
        (8) BFG9000

---------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 9: How will 2-4 player action work in DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------

        DOOM will support Novell Netware/IPX in the initial shareware
version.  TCP/IP and other protocols will be supported in a later version
soon after DOOM's release.  Using this network support, DOOM could be
played in a workplace type environment.
        DOOM will also work in two player mode by modem or serial
link.
        In DOOM, players will be able to see each other, and watch
each other jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players
will be able to watch others get hurt, die, and move throughout
the labyrinth.  DOOM will allow players to play together, working as 
a team.  In this cooperative mode, players can see each other on an
"automap" and switch to each other's view.
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level will be infested with enemies 
and power-ups.  Everyone must kill all the demons to ready the battlefield 
for the player vs. player manhunt (my favorite gaming word).  In this mode, 
players will not be able to see the other players in the automap, nor switch 
to their view.  Players will not be able to view other's health in the
mode, because of the disadvantage this can cause.
        With InterNet access, a 56K line, and only a few router hops,
you should be able to run DOOM over the InterNet.  An InterNet server is 
being planned to handle many DOOM players at once, but this is not a 
definite, and cannot be designed until the release of DOOM.  "I'll get to 
work on it as soon as the game comes out =)", says Saqib A Qureshi. 
(qureshi@ug.cs.dal.ca)
        The shareware version of DOOM *will* support multi-players.

------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 10: How can I contact id Software?
------------------------------------------

        id Software can be contacted via the InterNet.  If you would like to
ask any questions about DOOM (that are not answered in here), send
E-mail to help@idsoftware.com.        
        id Software can also be reached at their 800 number.  The
number is (800)-ID-GAMES.  This number is for ordering games ONLY.  This
number is not for technical support or inquires.

-------------------------
CHAPTER 11: DOOM iNsAnItY
-------------------------

        This chapter features humor about DOOM, written by ANYONE who's  
willing to try (or maybe even on accident).  Anyway, here they are.

[11-1]: A word from Douglas J. Bottoms
======================================
        FOREWORD:  Here's the first addition to DOOM iNsAnItY!
This was posted on comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action on Thursday,
October 21, 1993.  He speaks on a new game idea: id programmers
as bad guys in DOOM.

----------
Subject: NEW GAME!  id programmers as bad guys in DOOM!
From: Douglas J. Bottoms <DBottoms@Lilly.Com>
Date: Thu Oct 21 10:00:02 1993

That's it!!  I new twist on the game!!!  The DOOM good guys are idle
gaming buffs who have finally cracked and can no longer wait for the
release of the only game that will make ALL OTHER games seem like PONG!
Blind Wolfenstein will no longer simmer the anger!  They go slap-happy and
grab their multidimensional boots and gloves (with snazzy smooth shading)
and go to the id programmers' dungeon/lair.  It will be a slaughter!
Pixilated programmers, peeved project leaders, panting personnel...the
works.  The big bosses could be just that, the big bosses, especially the
one who just made a press release that DOOM would be delayed another few
months (this is make believe, of course - (squint) you aren't going to
delay the release (pant, pant);  look into my eyes  (o)(o) (imagine
reversing sound) and repeat after me, "I must release DOOM soon.  I must
program, eat, sleep day and night."  Mu who ha ha ha!).

Excuse my sanity.  I get a bit zany when I get thinking about the soon to
be released game that will resolve the U.S.' Deficit and save the rats
from being beheaded on the space shuttle.  I see the sun raising...

The thoughts expressed here are entirely my own and do not necessarily
reflect the thoughts of any other individual or group affiliated with Eli
Lilly and Company.

[11-2]: Top Ten Things to Do While Waiting for DOOM
===================================================
        FOREWORD:  This was posted by an unknown source at an unknown
location, on August 27, 1993.  If you know who the writer is, please
send me some E-mail so I can give appropriate credit.

----------
        Well, here we are waiting another 2-3 months [for DOOM].  What else 
can we do? 

1) Search the InterNet for Beta Version.
2) See if we can go through Wolfenstein 3-D with our eyes closed.
3) Use MapEdit/WolfEdit to make Wolfenstein 3-D "look like" DOOM.
4) Find out where the id "lab" is and "encourage" them.
5) Watch the new 90210 episode!
6) See if Blake Stone or Rampage will be any good.
7) Upload the Lemmings Demo as "DOOM10.ZIP" and see what happens.
8) Get girlfriends and drop them on 12/10/93, unless they like DOOM and
   have a computer with a modem.
9) Or lastly, look at DOOM slides and "pretend" we are playing.

CHAPTER 12: Conclusion
----------------------

        Well, there's v2.0 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ by Hank Leukart.  
Hopefully, this version of the FAQ should have been more informative than 
the first version, since id got involved, and started helping out.  Keep
up the good work, Id!  The FAQ will become MUCH more complicated after
the game is released.  There will be more chapters, and they will
have many more sub chapters.  If you know things that I don't feel free 
to suggest them via E-mail to "ap641@cleveland.freenet.edu".
